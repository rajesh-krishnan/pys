# pys: Patanjala Yogasutrani (पातञ्जल योगसुत्राणि)

## Prarthana (प्रार्थना) - Prayers 

```
ॐ सह नाववतु ।
सह नौ भुनक्तु ।
सह वीर्यं करवावहै ।
तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥
```

Om, together may we two (the teacher and the student) move (in our studies);
Together may we two relish (our studies);
Together may we two perform (our studies) with vigour;
May what has been studied by us be filled with the brilliance (of understanding); may it not give rise to hostility.
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

\- From the Taittiriya Upanishad (तैत्तिरीय उपनिषद्) of the Yajur Veda (यजुर्वेदः)

```
योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन । 
योपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि ॥
```

The impurities of the mind by yoga, speech by grammar and the impurities of the body through medical science,
he who is an expert in removing the impurities, to that most excellent of munis, Patanjali, I bow down with folded hands.

\- From a verse in Shivarama's commentary on the Yoga Sutras c. 18th century CE 

## Sankalpa (संकल्पः) - Intention Setting 

```
For removing all problems and pains in life,
for making Lord Parameshwara happy,
for the blessings and grace of Goddess Parvathi,
for the realization of the Self, and
for the peace and prosperity of all beings,
I am going to study the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
```

## About

The objective of this work is to support the study of Yoga, which is one of the six astika darshanas of Santana Dharma; any academic or technical excursions are incidental to the core pursuit. Please note that I have not learned Sanskrit, vedangas, or yoga under a guru (other than learning as an Ashram Yogi at Swami Satchidananda Ashram Yogaville in Buckingham VA, USA). Although I have a background in computer engineering, I have limited experience in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and web application development.

This repository will include resources for the study of the yoga sutras of Patanjali. Although the Patanjala yoga darshana is limited to using pratyaksha, anumana, and agama, we include translations and references to works by those who apply a vedantic interpretation (admitting upama, anupalabdhi, and athApatti as pramanas). Although the Patanjala Yoga Darshana is Agamic, we do not exclude translations and references to other Nigamic, Smriti, and Puranic sources; nor do we exclude sources from other Dharmic traditions such as Jaina, Bauddha, Veerashaiva, and Sikh, or other translators viewing this text through occidental or other hybrid lenses. We agree with the position of Veda Vyasa and Srima Adi Shankara Bhagadpada that there is no disharmony between the yoga and vedanta darsharnas. We do not include commentaries, and only quote the translations in a comparative study with attribution, so we believe the quotations constitute fair use of the translations. This is a work in progress.

We encode Sanskrit using ITRANS. Through a web page (`pys.html`), we support navigation by chapter and verse. For each verse, the web page provides the chapter name, chapter number, verse number, and verse text (in Devnagari Unicode, ITRANS, and IAST formats). For comparison, we provide translations by Swami Vivekananda, Swami Satchidananda, Gabriel Pradeepaka, B.K.S. Iyengar, T.K.V. Desikachar, Christopher Isherwood (Swami Prabhavananda), and Swami Jnanesvara Bharati. We provide an interface to a ITRANS to Devangarai Unicode and IAST transliteration tool as well as to an online Sanskrit dictionary. Users can add their notes for each sutra to an optional file, and see them with the included translations.

For now, we are attempting a client-side solution with static content that can be hosted locally or on a webserver; a modern browser supporting Javascript, HTML, and CSS should suffice. I was originally planning to release this software under the Unlicense, but unfortunately, the transliteration code by [Shreevatsa ji](http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/sanskrit/transliterate.html) has a GPLv2 or higher license. Note I have edited the transliteration code slightly to include the pranava (Om symbol).

### Future Work
Future versions of this code may include:
  1. Maharishi Veda Vyasa's commentary (in Devanagari Unicode, ITRANS, and IAST formats) along with translations (by Ganganath Jha)
  2. Cross references to related verses
  3. References to BG, Yoga Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, Hatha Yoga Pradeepika, Yoga Vashista, and other texts
  6. Modern translations by others, including possibly,Swami Venkatesananda, Jaganath Carera, Michael Beloved, and others
  6. Classical translations by Rajabhoja, Shivarama, and others

We are also looking at audio enunciation of each verse, either through recordings or the use of a speech to text tool. Similarly, we are also looking at providing grammatical analysis done either manually or by computer. Also, another thing to do is to fix this document to use ITRANS consistently for Sanskrit words. To reduce the cognitive burden, we plan to make the subset of information displayed user-selectable. We plan to include bibliographic references, as well as a Sanskrit word index with occurrence counts and cross-references to verses. There is not ETA for any of this.

## For further study

We list the major texts on yoga and some commentaries on the Patanjala Yogasutrani. We may provide additional notes and links in the future on yoga texts as well as sanskrit learning resources.
