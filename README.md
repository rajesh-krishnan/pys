# pys: Patanjala Yogasutrani (पातञ्जल योगसुत्राणि)

## Prarthana (प्रार्थना) - Prayers 

```
ॐ सह नाववतु ।
सह नौ भुनक्तु ।
सह वीर्यं करवावहै ।
तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥
```

Om, together may we two (the teacher and the student) move (in our studies);
Together may we two relish (our studies);
Together may we two perform (our studies) with vigour;
May what has been studied by us be filled with the brilliance (of understanding); may it not give rise to hostility.
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

\- From the Taittiriya Upanishad (तैत्तिरीय उपनिषद्) of the Yajur Veda (यजुर्वेदः)

```
योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन । 
योपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि ॥
```

The impurities of the mind by yoga, speech by grammar and the impurities of the body through medical science,
he who is an expert in removing the impurities, to that most excellent of munis, Patanjali, I bow down with folded hands.

\- From a verse in Shivarama's 18th century CE text **XXX: fix reference **

## Sankalpa (संकल्पः) - Intention Setting 

```
For removing all problems and pains in life,
for making Lord Parameshwara happy,
for the blessings and grace of Goddess Parvathi,
for the realization of the Self, and
for the peace and prosperity of all beings,
I am going to study the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
```

## Overview 

This repository will include resources for the study of the yoga sutras of Patanjali. Although the Patanjala yoga darshana is limited to using pratyaksha, anumana, and agama, we include translations and references to works by those who apply a vedantic interpretation (admitting upama, anupalabdhi, and athApatti as pramanas). Although the Patanjala Yoga Darshana is Agamic, we do not exclude translations and references to other Nigamic, Smriti, and Puranic sources; nor do we exclude sources from other Dharmic traditions such as Jaina, Bauddha, Veerashaiva, and Sikh, or other translators viewing this text through occidental or other hybrid lenses. This is a work in progress.

For navigation, we will include a verse locator table. We plan to include bibliographic references, as well as a Sanskrit word index with occurrence counts and cross-references to verses.

For each verse, we plan to include the following:
  * Chapter number 
  * Verse number
  * Verse in sanskrit (unicode)
  * Transliteration tool and output: Unicode hex, ITRANS, possibly others such as IAST
  * Word meanings
