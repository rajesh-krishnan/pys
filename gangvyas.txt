"10. Sutra 10: Besides there is no beginning about them, 
because of the eternity of desire.<p>

Com these residua there is no beginning, of 
the eternity of desire. The selfish may I not cease 
to exist," may I with in every individual, can- 
not be snid to be natural (product, and as such not eternal). 
Why ? (Because), How else. would there the newly 
infant Who has not yet experienced death--any fear of 
death, which is due only to aversion and ? For certainly 
s natural object does not admit of a canse cause). 
The fact therefore that the internal organ chained to 
eternal residua, through certain cansea, gets hold of some of 
the residua, and then forward for the experience of the 
spirit. 
Other theorists have asserted that the internal Organ is 
expansive and contractible, like the jar-and-mansion lamp ; 
and as it is of the same form thatof the body ; and 
thus would be exploined its existence in this as also 
its rebirth. The Musters ever down that, is 
Sive and contractible is only the function of the internal Organ, 
which of itself is omnipresent. This (internal organ) again 
is dependent on causes such as virtue and the like. The 
cause again is of two kinds--external and ; the former 
is such as is to bodily means--e. g., hymn--singing, charity 
and reverence; the latter depending on the internal organ 
alones--e. faith and the like. As is "The 
times of the Yogi, friendship and the like, are nutnrully 
independent of external means. and (as such) briug about the 
highest virtue these two canses, the mental is 
stronger. Why ? Because, what Can wisdom and 
disrnasion? who can render the Dandaka forest bare by 
action, without mental strength? and can drink 
up the ocean, like Agastya ?

enjoyment or of Isolation--were a nonentity, then 
Vour of experts with a view by mans of--that

of exhibiting to the present time the already existing effuse 
(lying latent). and not ot bringing fortu an altogether new 
entity. A perfectly established cause only help. the effect 
in a particular way, but does not pr«lnce any thing new. 
An object is always endowed with a number of properties a 
and such properties exist iu accordance with different «»ndi- 
And though the present, being related toe certain

/e.totion of form is only possible for the conditiona of the 
present ; and it is not possible for those of the past or of the 
f'ture. And during the existence of oar condition, it i. quite 
compatible that the other two conditions should exist in clcne 
relationship with the (same). object ; hence the existence of 
three conditions is not preaed by their non-existene.
