Tbe "modification of time" is the sapprenion of its

ibe and the inture. Sanyama has been defined as

takea together. Hence Vbe three Inodißcatioas being per-

denied to any object. Similarly there is no action withont 
mans; so the word implies all the agencies

object and the instrnmeuts (Cbuitra, tbe rice aud fire) being 
Ede only in order to spcify these; aud further we find single

as a verb)? thedistinct province of these word, meaning and 
idea—e.g., "the house is wkitenin/'—the word signiO•ing 
the verb ; and "the house is the word 
signifies the noun (so much for the word); 
meaning is consisting in the verb or in the noun; and 
(thirdly) the ides is that which apprehends the 
meanings. Why ? in convention the idea

"this is that," —the •white object" beiug the object or the word 
as well as of the idea. That is to Say, in the above example 
the idea is that of the honse io front being a white one, 
ever may the words in which the idea is express«l). And 
this object under its modifications is accompanied neither by 
the word, nor by the idea. Similarly the word and the ides 
do not accompany each other. The consciousness of the die

Why ? (Because), How else. would there the newly

The fact therefore that the internal organ chained to 
eternal residua, through certain canse•, gets hold of some of 
the residua, and then forward for the experience of the 
spirit. 
Other theorists have asserted that the internal Organ is 
expansive and contractible, like the jar-and-mansion lamp ; 
and as it is of the same form thatof the body ; and 
thus would be exploined its existence in this as also 
its rebirth. The Musters ever down that, is 
Sive and contractible is only the function of the internal Organ, 
which of itself is omnipresent. This (internal organ) again 
is dependent on causes such as virtue and the like. The

is such as is to bodily means—e. g., hymn—singing, charity

Con repression (or inverse resolation) of the Attri•

experience and isolation, and are (hence) unable to serve any 
farther of the soul, is I.olation. The sentient faculty 
ot the soul abiding in itself, i.e., disconnected from the 
attribntes of Baddhi, is pure; aud (sach a sentient faculty) 
continuing for ever in that condition, constitutes Isolation.
