It has been declared that Isolation follows at the end or 
the succession of the capacity of the Attributes. This Isola- 
tion is now described : 
Sutra (34) a--The repression of the Attributes, devoid 
of the soul's purpse, is the Isolation; or it is the 
sentient faculty abiding in itself. 
Con repression (or inverse resolation) of the Attria 
bates of the nature of and effect, that have fulfilled 
experience and isolation, and are (hence) unable to serve any 
farther of the soul, is I.olation. The sentient faculty 
ot the soul abiding in itself, i.e., disconnected from the 
attribntes of Baddhi, is pure; aud (sach a sentient faculty) 
continuing for ever in that condition, constitutes Isolation.
