"47. Sutra 47: From Samyama with regard to perception, 
nature, egoism, concomitance and usefulness, results 
mastery over the sense-organs.<p>
Sound and the rest in their generic and the specific
forms, constitute the perceived; the function of the senses 
with regard to this is perception; and this does not consist in 
the perception of the generic form alone ; for how could the 
perceive any object together With its SFcific forms 
which bas not been pereeiv«l ? 
Nature the aggregate 
with coexisting constituents, of the specific and generic 
(effects ) of the Baddbic Sattva which is of the nature of 
illumination. 
Their third form is self-consciousness consisting in "egoism" 
--the generic form of which the senses are the specific forms. 
The fonrth form are the Attributes, of the nature of Illumi- 
nation, Activity and Inertness, consisting in ascertainment (the 
property ot Buddhi.) whicb is constituted by the three attri- 
bates --whereof the sense-organs together with self-con- 
rioasness, are the modifications. 
The fifth form is the character of the of 
being for the soars purpose. 
From gradually Frtorming Sanyama over these five 
forms, tbc yogi subdues each of them separately--and frotn 
fivefold couquest proceeds the mastery ever the senses.

The fact therefore that the internal organ chained to 
eternal residua, through certain cansea, gets hold of some of 
the residua, and then forward for the experience of the 
spirit. 
Other theorists have asserted that the internal Organ is 
expansive and contractible, like the jar-and-mansion lamp ; 
and as it is of the same form thatof the body ; and 
thus would be exploined its existence in this as also 
its rebirth. The Musters ever down that, is 
Sive and contractible is only the function of the internal Organ, 
which of itself is omnipresent. This (internal organ) again 
is dependent on causes such as virtue and the like. The 
cause again is of two kinds--external and ; the former 
is such as is to bodily means--e. g., hymn--singing, charity

Con repression (or inverse resolation) of the Attria

experience and isolation, and are (hence) unable to serve any 
farther of the soul, is I.olation. The sentient faculty 
ot the soul abiding in itself, i.e., disconnected from the 
attribntes of Baddhi, is pure; aud (sach a sentient faculty) 
continuing for ever in that condition, constitutes Isolation.
