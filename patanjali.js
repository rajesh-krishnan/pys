/* English translation from The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Sri Swami Satchidananda) */
patanjali_data["satchidananda"] = [[
"Now the exposition of Yoga is being made.",
"The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga.",
"Then the Seer [Self] abides in His own nature.",
"At other times [the Self appears to] assume the forms of the mental modifications.",
"There are five kinds of mental modifications which are either painful or painless.",
"They are right knowledge, misconception, verbal delusion, sleep and memory.",
"The sources of right knowledge are direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony.",
"Misconception occurs when knowledge of something is not based upon its true form.",
"An image that arises on hearing mere words without any reality [as its basis] is verbal delusion.",
"That mental modification supported by cognition of nothingness is sleep.",
"When a mental modification of an object previously experienced and not forgotten comes back to consciousness, that is memory.",
"These mental modifications are restrained by practice and non-attachment.",
"Of these two, effort toward steadiness of mind is practice.",
"Practice becomes firmly grounded when well attended to for a long time, without break and in all earnestness.",
"The consciousness of self-mastery in one who is free from craving of objects seen or heard about is non-attachment.",
"When there is non-thirst for even the gunas (constituents of Nature) due to realization of the Purusha (true Self), that is supreme non-attachment.",
"Samprajnata samadhi (distinguished contemplation) is accompanied by reasoning, reflecting, rejoicing and pure I-am-ness.",
"By the firmly convinced practice of the complete cessation of the mental modiications, the impressions only remain. This is the other samadhi [asamprajnata nor non-distinguished].",
"Those who merely leave their physical bodies and attain the state of celestial deities, or those who get merged in Nature, have rebirth.",
"To the others, this asamprajnata samadhi could come through faith, strength, memory, contemplation or by discernment.",
"To the keen and intent practitioner this [samadhi] comes very quickly.",
"The time necessary for success further depends on whether the practice is mild, medium or intense.",
"Or [samadhi is attained] by devotion with total dedication to God [Isvara].",
"Isvara is the supreme Purusha, unaffected by any afflictions, actions, fruits of actions or by any inner impressions or desires.",
"In Him is the complete manifestation of the seed of omniscience.",
"Unconditioned by time, He is the teacher of even the most ancient teachers.",
"The word expressive of Isvara is the mystic sound OM. [Note: OM is God's name as well as form.]",
"To repeat it with reflection upon its meaning is an aid.",
"From this practice all the obstacles disappear and simultaneously dawns knowledge of the inner Self.",
"Disease, dullness, doubt, carelessness, laziness, sensuality, false perception, failure to reach firm ground and slipping from the ground gained -- these distractions of the mind-stuff are the obstacles.",
"Accompaniments to the mental distractions include distress, despair, trembling of the body, and disturbed breathing.",
"The practice of concentration on a single subject [or the use of one technique] is the best way to prevent the obstacles and their accompaniments.",
"By cultivating attitudes of friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and disregard toward the wicked, the mind-stuff retains its undisturbed calmness.",
"Or that calm is retained by the controlled exhalation or retention of the breath.",
"Or the concentration on subtle sense perceptions can cause steadiness of mind.",
"Or by concentrating on the supreme, ever-blissful Light within.",
"Or by concentrating on a great soul's mind which is totally freed from attachment to sense objects.",
"Or by concentrating on an experience had during dream or deep sleep.",
"Or by meditating on anything one chooses that is elevating.",
"Gradually, one's mastery in concentration extends from the primal atom to the greatest magnitude.",
"Just as the naturally pure crystal assumes shapes and colors of objects placed near it, so the Yogi's mind, with its totally weakened modifications, becomes clear and balanced and attains the state devoid of differentiation between knower, knowable and knowledge. This culmination of meditation is samadhi.",
"The samadhi in which name, form and knowledge of them is mixed is called savitarka samadhi, or samadhi with deliberation.",
"When the memory is well purified, the knowledge of the object of concentration shines alone, devoid of the distinction of name and quality. This is nirvitarka samadhi, or samadhi without deliberation.",
"In the same way, savichara (reflective) and nirvichara (super or non-reflective) samadhis, which are practiced upon subtle objects, are explained.",
"The subtlety of possible objects of concentration ends only at the undefinable.",
"All these samadhis are sabija (with seed), which could bring one back into bondage or mental disturbance.",
"In the purity of nirvichara samadhi, the supreme Self shines.",
"This is ritambhara prajna, or the absolute true consciousness.",
"This special truth is totally different from knowledge gained by hearing, study of scripture or inference.",
"The impression produced by this samadhi wipes out all other impressions.",
"When even this impression is wiped out, every impression is totally wiped out and there is nirbija [seedless] samadhi.",
],[
"Accepting pain as help for purification, study of spiritual books, and surrender to the Supreme Being constitute Yoga in practice.",
"They help us minimize obstacles and attain samadhi.",
"Ignorance, egoism, attachment, hatred, and clinging to bodily life are the five obstacles.",
"Ignorance is the field for the others mentioned after it, whether they be dormant, feeble, intercepted, or sustained.",
"Ignorance is regarding the impermanence as permanent, the impure as pure, the painful as pleasant, and the non-Self as the Self.",
"Egoism is the identification, as it were, of the power of the Seer (Purusha) with that of the instrument of seeing [body-mind].",
"Attachment is that which follows identification with pleasurable experiences.",
"Aversion is that which follows identification with painful experiences.",
"Clinging to life, flowing by its own potency [due to past experience], exists even in the wise.",
"In subtle form, these obstacles can be destroyed by resolving them back into their primal cause [the ego].",
"In the active state, they can be destroyed by meditation.",
"The womb of karmas (actions and reactions) has its root in these obstacles, and the karmas bring experiences in the seen [present] or in the unseen [future] births.",
"With the existence of the root, there will be fruits also: namely, the births of different species of life, their life spans and experiences.",
"The karmas bear fruits of pleasure and pain caused by merits and demerit.",
"To one of discrimination, everything is painful indeed, due to its consequences: the anxiety and fear over losing what is gained; the resulting impressions left in the mind to create renewed cravings; and the constant conflict among the three gunas, which control the mind.",
"Pain that has not yet come is avoidable.",
"The cause of that avoidable pain is the union of the Seer (Purusha) and the seen (Prakriti, or Nature).",
"The seen is of the nature of the gunas: illumination, activity and inertia; and consists of the elements and sense organs, whose purpose is to provide both experiences and liberation to the Purusha.",
"The stages of the gunas are specific, non-specific, defined and undefinable.",
"The Seer is nothing but the power of seeing which, although pure, appears to see through the mind.",
"The seen exists only for the sake of the Seer.",
"Although destroyed for him who has attained liberation, it [the seen] still exists for others, being common to them.",
"The union of Owner (Purusha) and owned (Prakriti) causes the recognition of the nature and powers of them both.",
"The cause of this union is ignorance.",
"Without this ignorance, no such union occurs. This is the independence of the Seer.",
"Uninterrupted discriminative discernment is the method for its removal.",
"One's wisdom in the final stage is sevenfold. [One experiences the end of 1) desire to know anything more; 2) desire to stay away from any thing; 3) desire to gain anything new; 4) desire to do anything; 5) sorrow; 6) fear; 7) delusion.]",
"By the practice of the limbs of Yoga, the impurities dwindle away and there dawns the light of wisdom, leading to discriminative discernment",
"The eight limbs of Yoga are:",
"Yama consists of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-greed.",
"These Great Vows are universal, not limited by class, place, time or circumstance.",
"Niyama consists of purity, contentment, acceptance but not causing pain, study of spiritual books and worship of God [self-surrender].",
"When disturbed by negative thoughts, opposite [positive] ones should be thought of. THis is pratipaksha bhavana.",
"When negative thoughts or acts such as violence, etc. are caused to be done or even approved of, whether incited by greed, anger or infatuation, whether indulged in with mild, medium or extreme intensity, they are based on ignorance and bring certain pain. Reflecting thus is also pratipaksha bhavanam.",
"In the presence of one firmly established in non-violence, all hostilities cease.",
"To one established in truthfulness, actions and their results become subservient.",
"To one established in non-stealing, all wealth comes.",
"By one established in continence, vigor is gained.",
"When non-greed is confirmed, a thorough illumination of the how and why of one's birth comes.",
"By purification arises disgust for one's own body and for contact with other bodies.",
"Moreover, one gains purity of sattva, cheerfulness of mind, one-pointedness, mastery over the senses, and fitness for Self-realization.",
"By contentment, supreme joy is gained.",
"By austerity, impurities of body and senses are destroyed and occult powers gained.",
"By study of spiritual books comes communion with one's chosen deity.",
"By total surrender to God, samadhi is attained.",
"Asana is a steady, comfortable posture.",
"By lessening the natural tendency for restlessness and by meditating on the infinite, posture is mastered.",
"Thereafter, one is undisturbed by the dualities.",
"That [firm posture] being acquired, the movements of inhalation and exhalation should be controlled. This is pranayama.",
"The modifications of the life-breath are either external, internal or stationary. They are to be regulated by space, time and number and are either long or short.",
"There is a fourth kind of pranayama that occurs during concentration on an internal or external object.",
"As its result, the veil over the inner Light is destroyed.",
"And the mind becomes fit for concentration.",
"When the senses withdraw themselves from the objects and imitate, as it were, the nature of the mind-stuff, this is pratyahara.",
"Then follows supreme mastery over the senses.",
],[
"Dharana is the binding of the mind to one place, object or idea.",
"Dhyana is the continuous flow of cognition toward that object.",
"Samadhi is the same meditation when there is the shining of the object alone, as if devoid of form.",
"The practice of these three [dharana, dhyana and samadhi] upon one object is called samyama.",
"By the mastery of samyama comes the light of knowledge.",
"Its practice is to be accomplished in stages.",
"These three [dharana, dhyana and samadhi] are more internal than the preceding five limbs.",
"Even these three are external to the seedless samadhi.",
"The impressions which normally arise are made to disappear by the appearance of suppressive efforts, which in turn create new mental modifications. The moment of conjunction of mind and new modifications is nirodha parinama.",
"The flow of nirodha parinama becomes steady through habit.",
"When there is a decline in distractedness and appearance of one-pointedness, then comes samadhi parinamah (development in samadhi).",

"The succession of these different phases is the cause of the differences in stages of evolution.",
"By practicing samyama on the three stages of evolution comes knowledge of past and future.",
"A word, its meaning,and the idea behind it are normally confused because of superimposition upon one another. By samyama on the word [or sound] produced by any being, knowledge of its meaning is obtained.",

"Karmas are of two kinds: quickly manifesting and slowly manifesting. By samyama on them, or on the portents of death, the knowledge of the time of death is obtained.",
"By samyama on friendliness and other such qualities, the power to transmit them is obtained.",
"By samyama on the strength of elephants and other such animals, their strength is obtained.",

"By samyama on the sun, knowledge of the entire solar system is obtained.",
"By samyama on the moon comes knowledge of the stars' alignment.",
"By samyama on the pole star comes knowledge of the stars' movements.",
"By samyama on the navel plexus, knowledge of the body's constitution is obtained.",
"By samyama on the pit of the throat, cessation of hunger and thirst is achieved.",
"By samyama on the kurma nadi (a subtle tortoise-shaped tube located below the throat), motionlessness in the meditative posture is achieved.",
"By samyama on the light at the crown of the head (sahasrara chakra), visions of masters and adepts are obtained.",
"Or, in the knowledge that dawns by spontaneous enlightenment [through a life of purity], all the powers come by themselves.",
"By samyama on the heart, the knowledge of the mind-stuff is obtained.",
"The intellect and the Purusha (or Atman) are totally different, the intellect existing for the sake of the Purusha, while the Purusha exists for its own sake. Not distinguishing this is the cause of all experiences; and by samyama on the distinction, knowledge of the Purusha is gained.",
"From this knowledge arises superphysical hearing, touching, seeing, tasting and smelling through spontaneous intuition.",
"These [superphysical senses] are obstacles to [nirbija] samadhi but are siddhis (powers or accomplishments) in the worldly pursuits.",
"By the loosening of the cause [of the bondage of mind to body] and by knowledge of the procedure of the mind-stuff's functioning, entering another's body is accomplished.",
"By mastery over the udana nerve current (the upward vital air), one accomplishes levitation over water, swamps, thorns, etc. and can leave the body at will.",
"By mastery over the samana nerve current (the equalizing vital air) comes radiance to surround the body.",
"By samyama on the relationship between ear and ether, supernormal hearing becomes possible.",
"By samyama on the relationship between the body and ether, lightness of cotton fiber is attained, and thus traveling through the ether becomes possible.",
"By samyama on thought waves unidentified by and external to the body [maha-videha, or the great bodilessness], the veil over the light of the Self is destroyed.",
"By samyama on the gross and subtle elements and on their essential nature, correlations and purpose, mastery over them is gained.",
"From that comes attainment of anima and other siddhis, bodily perfection and the non-obstruction of bodily functions by the influence of the elements. [Note: The eight major siddhis alluded to here are: anima (to become very small); mahima (to become very big); laghima (very light); garima (heavy); prapti (to reach anywhere); prakamya (to achieve all one's desires); isatva (ability to create anything); vasitva (ability to command and control everything).",
"Beauty, grace, strength, and adamantine hardness constitute bodily perfection.",
"By samyama on the power of perception and on the essential nature, correlation with the ego sense and purpose of the sense organs, mastery over them is gained.",
"From that, the body gains the power to move as fast as the mind, ability to function without the aid of the sense organs, and complete mastery over the primary cause (Prakriti).",
"By recognition of the distinction between sattva (the pure reflective nature) and the Self, supremacy over all states and forms of existence [omnipotence] is gained as is omniscience.",
"By non-attachment even to that [all these siddhis], the seed of bondage is destroyed and thus follows Kaivalya (Independence).",
"The Yogi should neither accept nor smile with pride at the admiration of even the celestial beings, as there is the possibility of his getting caught again in the undesirable.",
"By samyama on single moments in sequence comes discriminative knowledge.",
"Thus, the indistinguishable differences between objects that are alike in species, characteristic marks and positions become distinguishable.",
"The discriminative knowledge that simultaneously comprehends all objects in all conditions is the intuitive knowledge which brings liberation.",
"When the tranquil mind attains purity equal to that of the Self, there is Absoluteness.",
],[
"Siddhis are born of practices performed in previous births, or by herbs, mantra repetition, asceticism, or by samadhi.",
"The transformation of one species into another is brought about by the inflow of Nature.",
"Incidental events do no directly cause natural evolution; they just remove the obstacles as a farmer [removes the obstacles in a water course running to his field].",
"A Yogi's egoity alone is the cause of [other artificially] created minds.",
"Although the functions in the many created minds may differ, the original mind-stuff of the Yogi is the director of them all.",
"Only the minds born of meditation [the artificially created ones] are free from karmic impressions.",
"The actions of the Yogi are neither white [good] nor black [bad]; but the actions of others are of three kinds: good, bad and mixed.",
"Of these [actions], only those vasanas (subconscious impressions) for which there are favorable conditions for producing their fruits will manifest in a particular birth.",
"Although desires are separated from their fulfillments by class, space and time, they have an uninterrupted relationship because the impressions [of desires] and memories of them are identical.",
"Since the desire to live is eternal, impressions are also beginningless.",
"The impressions being held together by cause, effect, basis, and support, they disappear with the dissappearance of these four.",
"The past and future exist in the real form of objects which manifest due to differences in the conditions of their characteristics.",
"Whether manifested or subtle, these characteristics belong to the nature of the gunas.",
"The reality of things is due to the uniformity of the gunas' transformations.",
"Due to differences in various minds, perception of even the same object may vary.",
"Nor does an object's existence depend upon a single mind, for if it did, what would become of that object when that mind did not perceive it?",
"An object is known or unknown dependent on whether or not the mind gets colored by it.",
"Due to His changelessness, changes in the mind-stuff are always known to the Purusha, who is its Lord.",
"The mind-stuff is not self-luminous because it is an object of perception by the Purusha.",
"The mind-stuff cannot perceive both subject and object simultaneously [which proves it is not self-luminous].",
"If the perception of one mind by another mind be postulated, we would have to assume an endless number of them and the result would be confusion of memory.",
"The consciousness of the Purusha  is unchangeable; by getting the reflection of it, the mindstuff becomes conscious of the Self.",
"The mind-stuff, when colored by both Seer and seen, understands everything.",
"Though having countless desires, the mind-stuff exists for the sake of another [the Purusha] because it an act only in association with it.",
"To one who sees the distinction between the mind and the Atman, thoughts of mind as the Atman cease forever.",
"Then the mind-stuff is inclined toward discrimination and gravitates toward Absoluteness.",
"In between, distracting thoughts may arise due to past impressions.",
"They can be removed, as in the case of the obstacles explained before. [See Book 2, Sutras 1, 2, 10, 11 and 26.]",
"He who, due to his perfect discrimination, is totally disinterested even in the highest rewards remains in the constant discriminative discernment, which is called dharmamegha (cloud of dharma) samadhi. [Note: The meaning of dharma includes virtue, justice, law, duty, morality, religion, religious merit, and steadfast decree.]",
"From that samadhi all afflictions and karmas cease.",
"Then all the coverings and impurities of knowledge are totally removed. Because of the infinity of this knowledge, what remains to be known is almost nothing.",
"Then the gunas terminate their sequence of transformations because they have fulfilled their purpose.",
"The sequence [referred to above] means an uninterrupted succession of moments which can be recognized at the end of their transformations.",
"Thus, the supremestate of Independence manifests while the gunas reabsorb themselves into Prakriti, having no more purpose to serve the Purusha, Or, to look from another angle, the power of pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature.",

"By samyama on samana vayu, a yogi glows like fire and his aura shines.",
"By samyama on the relation between space and sound, the yogi acquires the power of hearing distant and divine sounds. The organ of hearing, the ear, grasps sound in space. This is the conquest of air.",
"By knowing the relationship between the body and ether, the yogi transforms his body and mind so that they become as light as cotton fibre. He can then levitate in space. This is the conquest of ether.",
"By samyama on mahavideha (the disembodied state), where consciousness acts outside the body, the veil covering the light of illumination is destroyed.",
"By samyama on the elements -- their mass, forms, subtlety, conjunction and purposes -- the yogi becomes Lord over them all.",

"Nature's efficient cause does not impel its potentialities into action, but helps to remove the obstacles to evolution, just as a farmer builds banks to irrigate his fields.",
"Constructed or created mind springs from the sense of individuality (asmita).",
"Consciousness is one, but it branches into many different types of activities and innumerable thought-waves.",
"Of these activities of consciousness of perfected beings, only those which proceed from meditation are free from latent impressions and influences.",
"A yogi's actions are neither white nor black. The actions of others are of three kinds, white, black or grey.",
"These three types of actions leave impressions which become manifest when conditions are favourable and ripe.",
"Life is a continuous process, even though it is demarcated by race, place and time. Due to the uninterrupted close relationship between memory and subliminal impressions, the fruits of actions remain intact from one life to the next, as if there were no separation between births.",
"These impressions, memories and desires have existed eternally, as the desire to live is eternal.",
"Impressions and desires are bound together by their dependence upon cause and effect. In the absence of the latter, the former too ceases to function.",
"The existence of the past and the future is as real as that of the present. As moments roll into movements which have yet to appear as the future, the quality of knowledge in one's intellect and consciousness is affected.",
"The three phases of time intermingle rhythmically and interweave with the qualities of nature. They change the composition of nature's properties into gross and subtle.",
"Unity in the mutation of time caused by the abiding qualities of nature, sattva, rajas and tamas, causes modifications in objects, but their unique essence, or reality, does not change.",
"Due to the variance in the quality of mind-content, each person may view the same object differently, according to his own way of thinking.",
"An object exists independent of its cognizance by any one consciousness. What happens to it when that consciousness is not there to perceive it?",
"An object remains known or unknown according to the conditioning or expectation of the consciousness.",
"Purusa is ever illuminative and changeless. Being constant and master of the mind, he always knows the moods and modes of consciousness.",
"Consciousness cannot illumine itself as it is a knowable object.",
"Consciousness cannot comprehend both the seer and itself at the same time.",
"If consciousness were manifold in one's being, each cognizing the other, the intelligence too would be manifold, so the projections of mind would be many, each having its own memory.",
"Consciousness distinguishes its own awareness and intelligence when it reflects and identifies its source -- the changeless seer -- and assumes his form.",
"Consciousness, reflected by the seer as well as by the seen, appears to be all-comprehending.",
"Though the fabric of consciousness is interwoven with innumerable desires and subconscious impressions, it exists for the seer on account of its proximity to the seer as well as to the objective world.",
"For one who realizes the distinction between citta and atma, the sense of separation between the two disappears.",
"Then consciousness is drawn strongly towards the seer or the soul due to the gravitational force of its exalted intelligence.",
"Notwithstanding this progress, if one is careless during the interval, a fissure arises due to past hidden impressions, creating division between the consciousness and the seer.",
"In the same way as the sadhaka strives to be free from afflictions, the yogi must handle these latent impressions judiciously to extinguish them.",
"The yogi who has no interest even in this highest state of evolution, and maintains supreme attentive, discriminative awareness, attains dharma-meghah samadhi: he contemplates the fragrance of virtue and justice.",
"Then comes the end of afflictions and of karma.",
"The, when the veils of impurities are removed, the highest, subjective, pure, infinite knowledge is attained, and the knowable, the finite, appears as trivial.",
"When dharmameghah samadhi is attained, qualities of nature (gunas) come to rest. Having fulfilled their purpose, their sequence of successive mutations is at an end.",
"As the mutations of the gunas cease to function, time, the uninterrupted movement of moments, stops. This deconstruction of the flow of tie is comprehensible only at this final stage of emancipation.",
"Kaivala, liberation, comes when the yogi has fulfilled the purusarthas, the fourfold aims of life, and has transcended the gunas. Aims and gunas return to their source, and consciousness is established in its own natural purity.",

"The five varieties of thought patterns to witness are: 1) knowing correctly (pramana), 2) incorrect knowing (viparyaya), 3) fantasy or imagination (vikalpa), 4) the object of void-ness that is deep sleep (nidra), and 5) recollection or memory (smriti).",
"Of these five, there are three ways of gaining correct knowledge (pramana): 1) perception, 2) inference, and 3) testimony or verbal communication from others who have knowledge.",
"Incorrect knowledge or illusion (viparyaya) is false knowledge formed by perceiving a thing as being other than what it really is.",
"Fantasy or imagination (vikalpa) is a thought pattern that has verbal expression and knowledge, but for which there is no such object or reality in existence.",
"Dreamless sleep (nidra) is the subtle thought pattern which has as its object an inertia, blankness, absence, or negation of the other thought patterns (vrittis).",
"Recollection or memory (smriti) is mental modification caused by the inner reproducing of a previous impression of an object, but without adding any other characteristics from other sources.",
"These thought patterns (vrittis) are mastered (nirodhah, regulated, coordinated, controlled, stilled, quieted) through practice (abhyasa) and non-attachment (vairagya).",
"Practice (abhyasa) means choosing, applying the effort, and doing those actions that bring a stable and tranquil state (sthitau).",
"When that practice is done for a long time, without a break, and with sincere devotion, then the practice becomes a firmly rooted, stable and solid foundation.",
"When the mind loses desire even for objects seen or described in a tradition or in scriptures, it acquires a state of utter (vashikara) desirelessness that is called non-attachment (vairagya).",
"Indifference to the subtlest elements, constituent principles, or qualities themselves (gunas), achieved through a knowledge of the nature of pure consciousness (purusha), is called supreme non-attachment (paravairagya).",
"The deep absorption of attention on an object is of four kinds, 1) gross (vitarka), 2) subtle (vichara), 3) bliss accompanied (ananda), and 4) with I-ness (asmita), and is called samprajnata samadhi.",
"The other kind of samadhi is asamprajnata samadhi, and has no object in which attention is absorbed, wherein only latent impressions remain; attainment of this state is preceded by the constant practice of allowing all of the gross and subtle fluctuations of mind to recede back into the field from which they arose.",
"Some who have attained higher levels (videhas) or know unmanifest nature (prakritilayas), are drawn into birth in this world by their remaining latent impressions of ignorance, and more naturally come to these states of samadhi.",
"Others follow a five-fold systematic path of 1) faithful certainty in the path, 2) directing energy towards the practices, 3) repeated memory of the path and the process of stilling the mind, 4) training in deep concentration, and 5) the pursuit of real knowledge, by which the higher samadhi (asamprajnata samadhi) is attained.",
"Those who pursue their practices with intensity of feeling, vigor, and firm conviction achieve concentration and the fruits thereof more quickly, compared to those of medium or lesser intensity.",
"Because the methods may be applied in slow, medium, or speedy ways, even among those who have such commitment and conviction, there are differences in the rate of progress, resulting in nine grades of practice.",
"From a special process of devotion and letting go into the creative source from which we emerged (ishvara pranidhana), the coming of samadhi is imminent.",
"That creative source (ishvara) is a particular consciousness (purusha) that is unaffected by colorings (kleshas), actions (karmas), or results of those actions that happen when latent impressions stir and cause those actions.",
"In that pure consciousness (ishvara) the seed of omniscience has reached its highest development and cannot be exceeded.",
"From that consciousness (ishvara) the ancient-most teachers were taught, since it is not limited by the constraint of time.",
"The sacred word designating this creative source is the sound OM, called pranava.",
"This sound is remembered with deep feeling for the meaning of what it represents.",
"From that remembering comes the realization of the individual Self and the removal of obstacles.",
"Nine kinds of distractions come that are obstacles naturally encountered on the path, and are physical illness, tendency of the mind to not work efficiently, doubt or indecision, lack of attention to pursuing the means of samadhi, laziness in mind and body, failure to regulate the desire for worldly objects, incorrect assumptions or thinking, failing to attain stages of the practice, and instability in maintaining a level of practice once attained.",
"From these obstacles, there are four other consequences that also arise, and these are: 1) mental or physical pain, 2) sadness or dejection, 3) restlessness, shakiness, or anxiety, and 4) irregularities in the exhalation and inhalation of breath.",
"To prevent or deal with these nine obstacle and their four consequences, the recommendation is to make the mind one-pointed, training it how to focus on a single principle or object.",
"In relationships, the mind becomes purified by cultivating feelings of friendliness towards those who are happy, compassion for those who are suffering, goodwill towards those who are virtuous, and indifference or neutrality towards those we perceive as wicked or evil.",
"The mind is also calmed by regulating the breath, particularly attending to exhalation and the natural stilling of breath that comes from such practice.",
"The inner concentration on the process of sensory experiencing, done in a way that leads towards higher, subtle sense perception; this also leads to stability and tranquility of the mind.",
"Or concentration on a painless inner state of lucidness and luminosity also brings stability and tranquility.",
"Or contemplating on having a mind that is free from desires, the mind gets stabilized and tranquil.",
"Or by focusing on the nature of the stream in the dream state or the nature of the state of dreamless sleep, the mind becomes stabilized and tranquil.",
"Or by contemplating or concentrating on whatever object or principle one may like, or towards which one has a predisposition, the mind becomes stable and tranquil.",
"When, through such practices, the mind develops the power of becoming stable on the smallest size object as well as on the largest, then the mind truly comes under control.",
"When the modifications of mind have become weakened, the mind becomes like a transparent crystal, and thus can easily take on the qualities of whatever object observed, whether that object be the observer, the means of observing, or an object observed, in a process of engrossment called samapatti.",
"One type of such an engrossment (samapatti) is one in which there is a mixture of three things, a word or name going with the object, the meaning or identity of that object, and the knowledge associated with that object; this engrossment is known as savitarka samapatti (associated with gross objects).",
"When the memory or storehouse of modifications of mind is purified, then the mind appears to be devoid of its own nature and only the object on which it is contemplating appears to shine forward; this type of engrossment is known as nirvitarka samapatti.",
"In the same way that these engrossments operate with gross objects in savitarka samapatti, the engrossment with subtle objects also operates, and is known as savichara and nirvichara samapatti.",
"Having such subtle objects extends all the way up to unmanifest prakriti.",
"These four varieties of engrossment are the only kinds of concentrations (samadhi) which are objective, and have a seed of an object.",
"As one gains proficiency in the undisturbed flow in nirvichara, a purity and luminosity of the inner instrument of mind is developed.",
"The experiential knowledge that is gained in that state is one of essential wisdom and is filled with truth.",
"That knowledge is different from the knowledge that is commingled with testimony or through inference, because it relates directly to the specifics of the object, rather than to those words or other concepts.",
"This type of knowledge that is filled with truth creates latent impressions in the mind-field, and those new impressions tend to reduce the formation of other less useful forms of habitual latent impressions.",
"When even these latent impressions from truth filled knowledge recede along with the other impressions, then there is objectless concentration.",
],[
"Yoga in the form of action (kriya yoga) has three parts: 1) training and purifying the senses (tapas), 2) self-study in the context of teachings (svadhyaya), and 3) devotion and letting go into the creative source from which we emerged (ishvara pranidhana).",
"That Yoga of action (kriya yoga) is practiced to bring about samadhi and to minimize the colored thought patterns (kleshas).",
"There are five kinds of coloring (kleshas): 1) forgetting, or ignorance about the true nature of things (avidya), 2) I-ness, individuality, or egoism (asmita), 3) attachment or addiction to mental impressions or objects (raga), 4) aversion to thought patterns or objects (dvesha), and 5) love of these as being life itself, as well as fear of their loss as being death.",
"The root forgetting or ignorance of the nature of things (avidya) is the breeding ground for the other of the five colorings (kleshas), and each of these is in one of four states: 1) dormant or inactive, 2) attenuated or weakened, 3) interrupted or separated from temporarily, or 4) active and producing thoughts or actions to varying degrees.",
"Ignorance (avidya) is of four types: 1) regarding that which is transient as eternal, 2) mistaking the impure for pure, 3) thinking that which brings misery to bring happiness, and 4) taking that which is not-self to be self.",
"The coloring (klesha) of I-ness or egoism (asmita), which arises from the ignorance, occurs due to the mistake of taking the intellect (buddhi, which knows, decides, judges, and discriminates) to itself be pure consciousness (purusha).",
"Attachment (raga) is a separate modification of mind, which follows the rising of the memory of pleasure, where the three modifications of attachment, pleasure, and the memory of the object are then associated with one another.",
"Aversion (dvesha) is a modification that results from misery associated with some memory, whereby the three modifications of aversion, pain, and the memory of the object or experience are then associated with one another.",
"Even for those people who are learned, there is an ever-flowing, firmly established love for continuation and a fear of cessation, or death, of these various colored modifications (kleshas).",
"When the five types of colorings (kleshas) are in their subtle, merely potential form, they are then destroyed by their disappearance or cessation into and of the field of mind itself.",
"When the modifications still have some potency of coloring (klishta), they are brought to the state of mere potential by meditation (dhyana).",
"Latent impressions that are colored (karmashaya) result from other actions (karmas) that were brought about by colorings (kleshas), and become active and experienced in a current life or a future life.",
"As long as those colorings (kleshas) remains at the root, three consequences are produced: 1) birth, 2) span of life, and 3) experiences in that life.",
"Because of having the nature of merits or demerits (virtue or vice), these three (birth, span of life, and experiences) may be experienced as either pleasure or pain.",
"A wise, discriminating person sees all worldly experiences as painful, because of reasoning that all these experiences lead to more consequences, anxiety, and deep habits (samskaras), as well as acting in opposition to the natural qualities.",
"Because the worldly experiences are seen as painful, it is the pain, which is yet to come that is to be avoided and discarded.",
"The uniting of the seer (the subject, or experiencer) with the seen (the object, or that which is experienced) is the cause or connection to be avoided.",
"The objects (or knowables) are by their nature of: 1) illumination or sentience, 2) activity or mutability, or 3) inertia or stasis; they consist of the elements and the powers of the senses, and exist for the purpose of experiencing the world and for liberation or enlightenment.",
"There are four states of the elements (gunas), and these are: 1) diversified, specialized, or particularized (vishesha), 2) undiversified, unspecialized, or unparticularized (avishesha), 3) indicator-only, undifferentiated phenomenal, or marked only (linga-matra), and 4) without indicator, noumenal, or without mark (alingani).",
"The Seer is but the force of seeing itself, appearing to see or experience that which is presented as a cognitive principle.",
"The essence or nature of the knowable objects exists only to serve as the objective field for pure consciousness.",
"Although knowable objects cease to exist in relation to one who has experienced their fundamental, formless true nature, the appearance of the knowable objects is not destroyed, for their existence continues to be shared by others who are still observing them in their grosser forms.",
"Having an alliance, or relationship between objects and the Self is the necessary means by which there can subsequently be realization of the true nature of those objects by that very Self.",
"Avidya or ignorance, the condition of ignoring, is the underlying cause that allows this alliance to appear to exist.",
"By causing a lack of avidya, or ignorance there is then an absence of the alliance, and this leads to a freedom known as a state of liberation or enlightenment for the Seer.",
"Clear, distinct, unimpaired discriminative knowledge is the means of liberation from this alliance.",
"Seven kinds of ultimate insight come to one who has attained this degree of discrimination.",
"Through the practice of the different limbs, or steps to Yoga, whereby impurities are eliminated, there arises an illumination that culminates in discriminative wisdom, or enlightenment.",
"The eight rungs, limbs, or steps of Yoga are the codes of self-regulation or restraint (yamas), observances or practices of self-training (niyamas), postures (asana), expansion of breath and prana (pranayama), withdrawal of the senses (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and perfected concentration (samadhi).",
"Non-injury or non-harming (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), abstention from stealing (asteya), walking in awareness of the highest reality (brahmacharya), and non-possessiveness or non-grasping with the senses (aparigraha) are the five yamas, or codes of self-regulation or restraint, and are the first of the eight steps of Yoga.",
"These codes of self-regulation or restraint become a great vow when they become universal and are not restricted by any consideration of the nature of the kind of living being to whom one is related, nor in any place, time or situation.",
"Cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha), an attitude of contentment (santosha), ascesis or training of the senses (tapas), self-study and reflection on sacred words (svadhyaya), and an attitude of letting go into one's source (ishvarapranidhana) are the observances or practices of self-training (niyamas), and are the second rung on the ladder of Yoga.",
"When these codes of self-regulation or restraint (yamas) and observances or practices of self-training (niyamas) are inhibited from being practiced due to perverse, unwholesome, troublesome, or deviant thoughts, principles in the opposite direction, or contrary thought should be cultivated.",
"Actions arising out of such negative thoughts are performed directly by oneself, caused to be done through others, or approved of when done by others. All of these may be preceded by, or performed through anger, greed or delusion, and can be mild, moderate or intense in nature. To remind oneself that these negative thoughts and actions are the causes of unending misery and ignorance is the contrary thought, or principle in the opposite direction that was recommended in the previous sutra.",
"As a Yogi becomes firmly grounded in non-injury (ahimsa), other people who come near will naturally lose any feelings of hostility.",
"As truthfulness (satya) is achieved, the fruits of actions naturally result according to the will of the Yogi.",
"When non-stealing (asteya) is established, all jewels, or treasures present themselves, or are available to the Yogi.",
"hen walking in the awareness of the highest reality (brahmacharya) is firmly established, then a great strength, capacity, or vitality (virya) is acquired.",
"When one is steadfast in non-possessiveness or non-grasping with the senses (aparigraha), there arises knowledge of the why and wherefore of past and future incarnations.",
"Through cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha), one develops an attitude of distancing, or disinterest towards one's own body, and becomes disinclined towards contacting the bodies of others.",
"Also through cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha) comes a purification of the subtle mental essence (sattva), a pleasantness, goodness and gladness of feeling, a one-pointedness with intentness, the conquest or mastery over the senses, and a fitness, qualification, or capability for self-realization.",
"From an attitude of contentment (santosha), unexcelled happiness, mental comfort, joy, and satisfaction is obtained.",
"hrough ascesis or training of the senses (tapas), there comes a destruction of mental impurities, and an ensuing mastery or perfection over the body and the mental organs of senses and actions (indriyas).",
"From self-study and reflection on sacred words (svadhyaya), one attains contact, communion, or concert with that underlying natural reality or force.",
"From an attitude of letting go into one's source (ishvarapranidhana), the state of perfected concentration (samadhi) is attained.",
"The posture (asana) for Yoga meditation should be steady, stable, and motionless, as well as comfortable, and this is the third of the eight rungs of Yoga.",
"The means of perfecting the posture is that of relaxing or loosening of effort, and allowing attention to merge with endlessness, or the infinite.",
"From the attainment of that perfected posture, there arises an unassailable, unimpeded freedom from suffering due to the pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, good and bad, or pain and pleasure).",
"Once that perfected posture has been achieved, the slowing or braking of the force behind, and of unregulated movement of inhalation and exhalation is called breath control and expansion of prana (pranayama), which leads to the absence of the awareness of both, and is the fourth of the eight rungs.",
"That pranayama has three aspects of external or outward flow (exhalation), internal or inward flow (inhalation), and the third, which is the absence of both during the transition between them, and is known as fixedness, retention, or suspension. These are regulated by place, time, and number, with breath becoming slow and subtle.",
"The fourth pranayama is that continuous prana which surpasses, is beyond, or behind those others that operate in the exterior and interior realms or fields.",
"Through that pranayama the veil of karmasheya (2.12) that covers the inner illumination or light is thinned, diminishes and vanishes.",
"Through these practices and processes of pranayama, which is the fourth of the eight steps, the mind acquires or develops the fitness, qualification, or capability for true concentration (dharana), which is itself the sixth of the steps.",
"When the mental organs of senses and actions (indriyas) cease to be engaged with the corresponding objects in their mental realm, and assimilate or turn back into the mind-field from which they arose, this is called pratyahara, and is the fifth step.",
"Through that turning inward of the organs of senses and actions (indriyas) also comes a supreme ability, controllability, or mastery over those senses inclining to go outward towards their objects.",
],[
"Concentration (dharana) is the process of holding or fixing the attention of mind onto one object or place, and is the sixth of the eight rungs.",
"The repeated continuation, or uninterrupted stream of that one point of focus is called absorption in meditation (dhyana), and is the seventh of the eight steps.",
"When only the essence of that object, place, or point shines forth in the mind, as if devoid even of its own form, that state of deep absorption is called deep concentration or samadhi, which is the eighth rung.",
"The three processes of dharana, dhyana, and samadhi, when taken together on the same object, place or point is called samyama.",
"Through the mastery of that three-part process of samyama, the light of knowledge, transcendental insight, or higher consciousness (prajna) dawns, illumines, flashes, or is visible.",
"That three-part process of samyama is gradually applied to the finer planes, states, or stages of practice.",
"These three practices of concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and samadhi are more intimate or internal than the previous five practices.",
"However, these three practices are external, and not intimate compared to nirbija samadhi, which is samadhi that has no object, nor even a seed object on which there is concentration.",
"That high level of mastery called nirodhah-parinamah occurs in the moment when there is a convergence of the rising tendency of deep impressions, the subsiding tendency, and the attention of the mind field itself.",
"The steady flow of this state (nirodhah-parinamah) continues by the creation of deep impressions (samskaras) from doing the practice.",
"The mastery called samadhi-parinamah is the transition whereby the tendency to all-pointedness subsides, while the tendency to one-pointedness arises.",
"The mastery called ekagrata-parinamah is the transition whereby the same one-pointedness arises and subsides sequentially.",
"These three transition processes also explain the three transformations of form, time, and characteristics, and how these relate to the material elements and senses.",
"There is an unmanifest, indescribable substratum or existence that is common or contained within all of the other forms or qualities.",
"Change in the sequence of the characteristics is the cause for the different appearances of results, consequences, or effects.",
"By samyama on the three-fold changes in form, time, and characteristics, there comes knowledge of the past and future.",
"The name associated with an object, the object itself implied by that name, and the conceptual existence of the object, all three usually interpenetrate or commingle with one another. By samyama on the distinction between these three, the meaning of the sounds made by all beings becomes available.",
"Through the direct perception of the latent impressions (samskaras) comes the knowledge of previous incarnations.",
"By samyama on the notions or presented ideas comes knowledge of another's mind.",
"But the underlying support of that knowledge (of the other persons mind, in 3.19) remains unperceived or out of reach.",
"When samyama is done on the form of one's own physical body, the illumination or visual characteristic of the body is suspended, and is thus invisible to other people.",
"In the same way as described in relation to sight (3.21), one is able to suspend the ability of the body to be heard, touched, tasted, or smelled.",
"Karma is of two kinds, either fast or slow to manifest; by samyama on these karmas comes foreknowledge of the time of death.",
"By samyama on friendliness (and the other attitudes of 1.33), there comes great strength of that attitude.",
"By samyama on the strength of elephants comes a similar strength.",
"By directing the flash of inner light of higher sensory activity, knowledge of subtle objects, those hidden from view, and those very distant can be attained.",
"By samyama on the inner sun, knowledge of the many subtle realms can be known.",
"By samyama on the moon, knowledge of the arrangement of the inner stars can be known.",
"By samyama on the pole-star, knowledge of the movement of those stars can be known.",
"By samyama on the navel center, knowledge of the arrangement of the systems of the body can be known.",
"By samyama on the pit of the throat, hunger and thirst leave.",
"By samyama on the tortoise channel, below the throat, steadiness is attained.",
"By samyama on the coronal light of the head, visions of the siddhas, the masters can come.",
"Or, through the intuitive light of higher knowledge, anything might become known.",
"By practicing samyama on the heart, knowledge of the mind is attained.",
"The having of experiences comes from a presented idea only when there is a commingling of the subtlest aspect of mind (sattva) and pure consciousness (purusha), which are really quite different. Samyama on the pure consciousness, which is distinct from the subtlest aspect of mind, reveals knowledge of that pure consciousness.",
"From the light of the higher knowledge of that pure consciousness or purusha (3.36) arises higher, transcendental, or divine hearing, touch, vision, taste, and smell.",
"These experiences resulting from samyama are obstacles to samadhi, but appear to be attainments or powers to the outgoing or worldly mind.",
"By loosening or letting go of the causes of bondage and attachment, and by following the knowledge of how to go forth into the passages of the mind, there comes the ability to enter into another body.",
"By the mastery over udana, the upward flowing prana vayu, there is a cessation of contact with mud, water, thorns, and other such objects, and there ensues the rising or levitation of the body.",
"By mastery over samana, the prana flowing in the navel area, there comes effulgence, radiance, or fire.",
"By samyama over the relation between space and the power of hearing, the higher, divine power of hearing comes.",
"By Samyama on the relationship between the body and space (akasha) and by concentrating on the lightness of cotton, passage through space can be attained.",
"When the formless thought patterns of mind are projected outside of the body, it is called maha-videha, a great disincarnate one. By samyama on that outward projection, the veil over the spiritual light is removed.",
"By samyama on the five forms of the elements (bhutas), which are gross form, essence, subtleness, interconnectedness, and it's purpose, then mastery over those bhutas is attained.",
"Through that mastery over the elements, comes the abilities of making the body atomically small, perfect, and indestructible in its characteristics or components, as well as bringing other such powers.",
"This perfection of the body includes beauty, gracefulness, strength, and adamantine hardness in taking the blows that come.",
"By samyama on the process of perception and action, essence, I-ness, connectedness, and purposefulness of senses and acts, mastery over those senses and acts (indriyas) is attained.",
"By that mastery over the senses and acts (indriyas), there comes quickness of mind, perception with the physical instruments of perception, and mastery over the primal cause out of which manifestation arises.",
"To one well established in the knowledge of the distinction between the purest aspect of mind and consciousness itself, there comes supremacy over all forms or states of existence, as well as over all forms of knowing.",
"With non-attachment or desirelessness even for that supremacy over forms and states of existence and the omniscience (3.50), the seeds at the root of those bondages are destroyed, and absolute liberation is attained.",
"When invited by the celestial beings, no cause should be allowed to arise in the mind that would allow either acceptance of the offer, or the smile of pride from receiving the invitation, because to allow such thoughts to arise again might create the possibility of repeating undesirable thoughts and actions.",
"By samyama over the moments and their succession, there comes the higher knowledge that is born from discrimination.",
"From that discriminative knowledge (3.53) comes awareness of the difference or distinction between two similar objects, which are not normally distinguishable by category, characteristics, or position in space.",
"That higher knowledge is intuitive and transcendent, and is born of discrimination; it includes all objects within its field, all conditions related to those objects, and is beyond any succession.",
"",
],[
"The subtler attainments come with birth or are attained through herbs, mantra, austerities or concentration.",
"The transition or transformation into another form or type of birth takes place through the filling in of their innate nature.",
"Incidental causes or actions do not lead to the emergence of attainments or realization, but rather, come by the removal of obstacles, much like the way a farmer removes a barrier (sluice gate), so as to naturally allow the irrigation of his field.",
"The emergent mind fields springs forth from the individuality of I-ness (asmita).",
"While the activities of the emergent mind fields may be diverse, the one mind is the director of the many.",
"Of these mind fields, the one that is born from meditation is free from any latent impressions that could produce karma.",
"The actions of yogis are neither white nor black, while they are threefold for others.",
"Those threefold actions result in latent impressions (vasanas) that will later arise to fruition only corresponding to those impressions.",
"Since memory (smriti) and the deep habit patterns (samskaras) are the same in appearance, there is an unbroken continuity in the playing out of those traits, even though there might be a gap in location, time, or state of life.",
"There is no beginning to the process of these deep habit patterns (samskaras), due to the eternal nature of the will to live.",
"Since the impressions (4.10) are held together by cause, motive, substratum, and object, they disappear when those deep impressions disappear.",
"Past and future exist in the present reality, appearing to be different because of having different characteristics or forms.",
"Whether these ever-present characteristics or forms are manifest or subtle, they are composed of the primary elements called the three gunas.",
"The characteristics of an object appear as a single unit, as they manifested uniformly from the underlying elements.",
"Although the same objects may be perceived by different minds, they are perceived in different ways, because those minds manifested differently.",
"However, the object itself does not depend on any one mind, for if it did, then what would happen to the object if it were not being experienced by that mind?",
"Objects are either known or not known according to the way in which the coloring of that object falls on the coloring of the mind observing it.",
"The activities of the mind are always known by the pure consciousness, because that pure consciousness is superior to, support of, and master over the mind.",
"That mind is not self-illuminating, as it is the object of knowledge and perception by the pure consciousness.",
"Nor can both the mind and the illuminating process be cognized simultaneously.",
"If one mind were illumined by another, as its master, then there would be an endless and absurd progression of cognitions, as well as confusion.",
"When the unchanging consciousness appears to take on the shape of that finest aspect of mind-field (4.18), then the experience of one's own cognition process is possible.",
"Therefore, the mind field, which is colored by both seer and seen, has the potential to perceive any and all objects.",
"That mind field, though filled with countless impressions, exists for the benefit of another witnessing consciousness, as the mind field is operating only in combination with those impressions.",
"For one who has experienced this distinction between seer and this subtlest mind, the false identities and even the curiosity about the nature of one's own self come to an end.",
"Then the mind is inclined towards the highest discrimination, and gravitates towards absolute liberation between seer and seen.",
"When there are breaks or breaches in that high discrimination, other impressions arise from the deep unconscious.",
"The removal of those interfering thought patterns is by the same means by which the original colorings were removed.",
"When there is no longer any interest even in omniscience, that discrimination allows the samadhi, which brings an abundance of virtues like a rain cloud brings rain.",
"After that dharma-meghah samadhi, the colorings of the kleshas and the karmas are removed.",
"Then, by the removal of those veils of imperfection, there comes the experience of the infinite, and the realization that there is almost nothing to be known.",
"Also resulting from that dharma-meghah samadhi (4.29), the three primary elements or gunas (4.13-4.14) will have fulfilled their purpose, cease to transform into further transformations, and recede back into their essence.",
"The sequencing process of moments and impressions corresponds to the moments of time, and is apprehended at the end point of the sequence.",
"When those primary elements involve, or resolve themselves back into that out of which they emerged, there comes liberation, wherein the power of pure consciousness becomes established in its true nature.",

patanjali_data["cisherwood"] = [[
"This is the beginning of instruction in yoga.",
"Yoga is the control of thought-waves in the mind.",
"Then man abides in his real nature.",
"At other times, when he is not in the state of yoga, man remains identified with the thought-waves in the mind.",
"There are five kinds of thought-waves -- some painful, others not painful.",
"These five kinds of thought-waves are: right knowledge, wrong knowledge, verbal delusion, sleep and memory.",
"The right kinds of knowledge are: direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony.",
"Wrong knowledge is knowledge which is false and not based upon the true nature of its object.",
"Verbal delusion arises when words do not correspond to reality.",
"Sleep is a wave of thought about nothingness.",
"Memory is when perceived objects are not forgotten, but come back to consciousness.",
"They are controlled by means of practice and non-attachment.",
"Practice is the repeated effort to follow the disciplines which give permanent control of the thought-waves of the mind.",
"Practice becomes firmly grounded when it has been cultivated for a long time, uninterruptedly, with earnest devotion.",
"Non-attachment is self-mastery; it is freedom from desire for what is seen or heard.",
"When, through knowledge of the Atman, one ceases to desire any manifestations of Nature, then that is the highest kind of non-attachment.",
"Concentration upon a single object may reach four stages: examination, discrimination, joyful peace and simple awareness of individuality.",
"The other kind of concentration is that in which the consciousness contains no object -- only subconscious impressions, which are like burnt seeds. It is attained by constantly checking the thought-waves through the practice of non-attachment.",
" When such concentration is not accompanied by non-attachment, and ignorance therefore remains, the aspirant will reach the state of the disincarnate gods or become merged in the forces of Nature.",
"The concentration of the true spiritual aspirant is attained through faith, energy, recollectedness, absorption and illumination.",
"Success in yoga comes quickly to those who are intensely energetic.",
"Success varies according to the means adopted to obtain it -- mild, medium or intense.",
"Concentration may also be attained through devotion to Ishwara.",
"Ishwara is a special kind of Being, untouched by ignorance and the products of ignorance, not subject to karmas or samskaras or the results of action.",
"In Him, knowledge is infinite; in others it is only a germ.",
"He was the teacher even of the earliest teachers, since He is not limited by time.",
"The word which express Him is OM.",
"This word must be repeated with meditation upon its meaning.",
"Hence comes knowledge of the Atman and destruction of the obstacles to that knowledge.",
"Sickness, mental laziness, doubt, lack of enthusiasm, sloth, craving for sense-pleasure, false perception, despair caused by failure to concentrate and unsteadiness in concentration: these distractions are the obstacles to knowledge.",
"These distractions are accompanied by grief, despondency, trembling of the body and irregular breathing.",
"They can be removed by the practice of  concentration upon a single truth.",
"Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by cultivating friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference toward the wicked.",
"The mind may also be calmed by expulsion and retention of the breath.",
"Those forms of concentration which result in extraordinary perceptions encourage perseverance of the mind.",
"Concentration may also be attained by fixing the mind upon the Inner Light, which is beyond sorrow.",
"Or by meditating on the heart of an illumined soul, that is free from passion.",
"Or by fixing the mind upon a dream experience, or the experience of deep sleep.",
"Or by fixing the mind upon any divine form or symbol that appeals to one as good.",
"The mind of a yogi can concentrate upon any object of any size, from the atomic to the infinitely great.",
"Just as the pure crystal takes color from the object which is nearest to it, so the mind, when it is cleared of thought-waves, achieves sameness or identity with the object of its concentration. This may be either a gross object, or the organ of perception, or the sense of ego. This achievement of sameness or identity with the object of concentration is known as samadhi.",
"When the mind achieves identity with a gross object of concentration, mixed with awareness of name, quality and knowledge, this is called savitarka samadhi.",
"When the mind achieves identity with a gross object of concentration, unmixed with awareness of name, quality and knowledge, so that the object alone remains, this is called nirvitarka samadhi.",
"When the object of concentration is a subtle object, two kinds of samadhi, called savichara and nirvichara, may be distinguished in the same manner.",
"Behind all subtle objects is Prakriti, the primal cause.",
"These kinds of samadhi are said to be 'with seed.'",
"In reaching nirvichara samadhi the mind becomes pure.",
"In that samadhi, knowledge is said to be 'filled with truth.'",
"The knowledge which is gained from inference and the study of scriptures is knowledge of one kind. But the knowledge which is gained from samadhi is of a much higher order. It goes beyond inference and scriptures.",
"The impression which is made upon the mind by that samadhi wipes out all other past impressions.",
"When the impression made by that samadhi is also wiped out, so that there are no more thought-waves at all in the mind, then one enters the samadhi which is called 'seedless.'",
],[
"Austerity, study, and the dedication of the fruits of one's work to God: these are the preliminary steps toward yoga.",
"Thus we may cultivate the power of concentration and remove the obstacles to enlightenment which cause all our sufferings.",
"These obstacles -- the causes of man's sufferings -- are ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life.",
"Ignorance creates all the other obstacles. They may exist either in a potential or a vestigial form, or they may have been temporarily overcome or fully developed.",
"To regard the noneternal as eternal, the impure as pure, the painful as pleasant and the non-Atman as the Atman -- this is ignorance.",
"To identify consciousness with that which merely reflects consciousness -- this is egoism.",
"Attachment is that which dwells upon pleasure.",
"Aversion is that which dwells upon pain.",
"The desire to cling to life is inherent both in the ignorant and in the learned. This is because the mind retains impressions of the death experience from many previous incarnations.",
"When these obstacles have been reduced to a vestigial for, they can be destroyed by resolving the mind back into its primal cause..",
"In their fully developed form, they can be overcome through meditation.",
"A man's latent tendencies have been created by his past thoughts and actions. These tendencies will bear fruits, both in this life and in lives to come.",
"So long as the cause exists, it will bear fruits -- such as rebirth, a long or a short life, and the experiences of pleasure and of pain.",
"Experiences of pleasure and of pain are the fruits of merit and demerit, respectively.",
"But the man of spiritual discrimination regards all these experiences as painful. For even the enjoyment of present pleasure is painful, since we already fear its loss. Past pleasure is painful because renewed cravings arise from the impressions it has left upon the mind. And how can any happiness be lasting if it depends only upon our moods? For these moods are constantly changing, as one or another of the ever-warring gunas seizes control of the mind.",
"The pain which is yet to come may be avoided.",
"This pain is caused by false identification of the experiencer with the object of experience. It may be avoided.",
"The object of experience is composed of the three gunas -- the principles of illumination (sattwa), activity (rajas) and inertia (tamas). From these, the whole universe has evolved, together with the instruments of knowledge -- such as the mind, senses, etc. -- and the objects perceived -- such as the physical elements. The universe exists in order that the experiencer may experience it, and thus become liberated.",
"The gunas pass through four states -- gross, subtle, primal and unevolved.",
"The Atman -- the experiencer -- is pure consciousness. It appears to take on the changing colors of the mind. In reality, it is unchangeable.",
"The object of experience exists only to serve the purpose of the Atman.",
"Though the object of experience becomes unreal to him who has reached the state of liberation it remains real to all other beings.",
"The Atman -- the experiencer -- is identified with Prakriti -- the object of experience -- in order that the true nature of both Prakriti and Atman may be known.",
"This identification is caused by ignorance.",
"When ignorance has been destroyed, this identification ceases. Then bondage is at an end and the experiencer is independent and free.",
"Ignorance is destroyed by awakening to knowledge of the Atman, until no trace of illusion remains.",
"The experiencer gains this knowledge in seven stages, advancing toward the highest.",
"As soon as all impurities have been removed by the practice of spiritual disciplines -- the 'limbs' of yoga -- a man's spiritual vision opens to the light-giving knowledge of the Atman.",
"The eight limbs of yoga are: the various forms of abstention from evil-doing (yama), the various observances (niyamas), posture (asana), control of the prana (pranayama), withdrawal of the mind from sense objects (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana) and absorption in the Atman (samadhi).",
"Yama is abstention from harming others, from falsehood, from theft, from incontinence, and from greed.",
"These forms of abstention are basic rules of conduct. They must be practiced without any reservations as to time, place, purpose, or caste rules.",
"The niyamas (observances) are purity, contentment, mortification, study and devotion to God.",
"To be free from thoughts that distract one from yoga, thoughts of an opposite kind must be cultivated.",
"The obstacles to yoga -- such as acts of violence and untruth -- may be directly created or indirectly caused or approved, they may be motivated by greed, anger or self-interest, they may be small or moderate or great, but they never cease to result in pain and ignorance. One should overcome distracting thoughts by remembering this.",
"When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from harming others, then all living creatures will cease to feel enmity in his presence.",
"When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from falsehood he gets the power of obtaining for himself and others the fruits of good deeds, without having to perform the deeds themselves.",
"When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from theft, all wealth comes to him.",
"When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from incontinence, he acquires spiritual energy.",
"When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from greed, he gains knowledge of his past, present and future existences.",
"As the result of purity, there arises indifference toward the body and disgust for physical intercourse with others.",
"Moreover, one achieves purification of the heart, cheerfulness of mind, the power of concentration, control of the passions and fitness for vision of the Atman.",
"As a result of contentment, one gains supreme happiness.",
"As the result of mortification, impurities are removed. Then special powers come to the body and the sense-organs.",
"As the result of study, one obtains the vision of that aspect of God which one has chosen to worship.",
"As the result of devotion to God, one achieves samadhi.",
"Posture (asana) is to be seated in a position which is firm but relaxed.",
"Posture becomes firm and relaxed through control of the natural tendencies of the body, and through meditation on the Infinite.",
"Thereafter, one is no longer troubled by the dualities of sense-experience.",
"After mastering posture, one must practice control of the prana (pranayama) by stopping the motions of inhalation and exhalation.",
"The breath may be stopped externally, or internally, or checked in mid-motion, and regulated according to place, time and a fixed number of moments, so that the stoppage is either protracted or brief.",
"The fourth kind of pranayama is the stoppage of the breath which is caused by concentration upon external or internal objects.",
"As the result of this, the covering of the Inner Light is removed.",
"The mind gains the power of concentration (dharana).",
"When the mind is withdrawn from sense-objects, the sense-organs also withdraw themselves from their respective objects and thus are said to imitate the mind. This is known as pratyahara.",
"Thence arises complete mastery over the senses.",
],[
"Concentration (dharana) is holding the mind within a center of spiritual consciousness in the body, or fixing it on some divine form, either within the body or outside it.",
"Meditation (dhyana) is an unbroken flow of thought toward the object of concentration.",
"When, in meditation, the true nature of the object shines forth, not distorted by the mind of the perceiver, that is absorption (samadhi).",
"When these three -- concentration, meditation and absorption --  are brought to bear upon one subject, they are called samyama.",
"Through mastery of samyama comes the light of knowledge.",
"It must be applied stage by stage.",
"These three are more direct aids to experience than the five limbs previously described.",
"But even these are not direct aids to the seedless samadhi.",
"When the vision of the lower samadhi is suppressed by an act of conscious control, so that there are no longer any thoughts or visions in the mind, that is the achievement of control of the thought-waves of the mind.",
"When this suppression of thought-waves becomes continuous, the mind's flow is calm.",
"When all mental distractions disappear and the mind becomes one-pointed, it enters the state called samadhi.",
"The mind becomes one-pointed when similar thought-waves arise in succession without any gaps between them.",
"In this state, it passes beyond the three kinds of changes which take place in subtle or gross matter, and in the organs: change of form, change of time and change of condition.",
"A compound object has attributes and is subject to change, either past, present or yet to be manifested.",
"The succession of these changes is the cause of manifold evolution.",
"By making samyama on the three kinds of changes, one obtains knowledge of the past and the future.",
"By making samyama on the sound of a word, one's perception of its meaning, and one's reaction to it -- three things which are ordinarily confused -- one obtains understanding of all sounds uttered by living beings.",
"By making samyama on previous thought-waves, one obtains knowledge of one's past lives.",
"By making samyama on the distinguishing marks of another man's body, one obtains knowledge of the nature of his mind.",
"But not of its contents, because that is not the object of the samyama.",
"If one makes samyama on the form of one's body, obstructing its perceptibility and separating its power of manifestation from the eyes of the beholder, then one's body becomes invisible.",
"Thus, also its sounds cease to be heard.",
"By making samyama on two kinds of karma -- that which will soon bear fruit and that which will not bear fruit until later -- or by recognizing the portents of death, a yogi may know the exact time of his separation from the body.",
"By making samyama on friendliness, compassion, etc., one develops the powers of these qualities.",
"By making samyama on any kind of strength, such as that of the elephant, one obtains that strength.",
"By making samyama on the Inner Light, one obtains knowledge of what is subtle, hidden, or far distant.",
"By making samyama on the sun, one gains knowledge of the cosmic spaces.",
"By making samyama on the moon, one gains knowledge of the arrangement of the stars.",
"By making samyama on the polestar, one gains knowledge of the motions of the stars.",
"By making samyama on the navel, one gains knowledge of the constitution of the body.",
"By making samyama on the the hollow of the throat, one stills hunger and thirst.",
"By making samyama on the tube within the chest, one acquires absolute motionlessness.",
"By making samyama on the radiance within the back of the head, one becomes able to see the celestial beings.",
"All these powers of knowledge may also come to one whose mind is spontaneously enlightened through purity.",
"By making samyama on the heart, one gains knowledge of the contents of the mind.",
"The power of enjoyment arises from a failure to discriminate between the Atman and the sattwa guna, which are totally different. The sattwa guna is merely the agent of the Atman, which is independent, existing only for its own sake. By making samyama on the independence of the Atman, one gains knowledge of the Atman.",
"Hence one gains the knowledge due to spontaneous enlightenment, and obtains supernatural powers of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell.",
"They are powers in the worldly state, but they are obstacles to samadhi.",
"When the bonds of the mind caused by karma have been loosened, the yogi can enter into the body of another by knowledge of the operation of its nerve-currents.",
"By controlling the nerve-currents that govern the lungs and the upper part of the body, the yogi can walk on water and swamps, or on thorns and similar objects, and he can die at will.",
"By controlling the force which governs the prana, he can surround himself with a blaze of light.",
"By making samyama on the relation between the ear and the ether, one obtains supernatural powers of hearing.",
"By making samyama on the relation between the body and the ether, or by acquiring through meditation the lightness of cotton fiber, the yogi can fly through the air.",
"By making samyama on the thought-waves of the mind when it is separated from the body -- the state known as the Great Disincarnation -- all coverings can be removed from the light of knowledge.",
"By making samyama on the gross and subtle forms of the elements, on their essential characteristics and the inherence of the gunas in them, and on the experiences they provide for the individual, one gains mastery of the elements.",
"Hence one gains the power of becoming as tiny as an atom and all similar powers; also perfection of the body, which is no longer subject to the obstructions of the elements.",
"Perfection of the body includes beauty, grace, strength and the hardness of a thunderbolt.",
"By making samyama on the transformation that sense-organs undergo when they contact objects, on the power of illumination of the sense-organs, on the ego-sense, on the gunas which constitute the organs, and on the experiences they provide for the individual, one gains mastery of the organs.",
"Hence the body gains the power of movement as rapid as that of the mind, the power of using the sense-organs outside the confines of the body, and the mastery of Prakriti.",
"By making samyama on the discrimination between the sattwa guna and the Atman, one gains omnipotence and omniscience.",
"By giving up even these powers, the seed of evil is destroyed and liberation follows.",
"When tempted by the invisible beings in high places, let the yogi feel neither allured nor flattered; for he is in danger of being caught once more by ignorance.",
"By making samyama on single moments and on their sequence in time, one gains discriminative knowledge.",
"Thus one is able to distinguish between two exactly similar objects, which cannot be distinguished by their spaces, characteristic marks, or positions in space.",
"This discriminative knowledge delivers a man from the bondage of ignorance. It comprehends all objects simultaneously, at every moment of their existence and in all their modifications.",
"Perfection is attained when the mind becomes as pure as the Atman itself.",
],[
"The psychic powers may be obtained either by birth, or by means of drugs, or by the power of words, or by the practice of austerities, or by concentration.",
"The transformation of one species into another is caused by the inflowing of nature.",
"Good or bad deeds are not the direct causes of the transformation. They only act as breakers of the obstacles to natural evolution; just as a farmer breaks down the obstacles in a water course, so that water flows through by its own nature.",
"The ego-sense alone can create minds.",
"Though the activities of the different created minds are various, the one original mind controls them all.",
"Of the various types of mind, only that which is purified by samadhi is freed from all latent impressions of karma and from all cravings.",
"The karma of the yogi is neither white nor black. The karma of others is of three kinds: white, black, or mixed.",
"Of the tendencies produced by these three kinds of karma, only those are manifested for which the conditions are favorable.",
"Because of our memory of past tendencies, the chain of cause and effect is not broken by change of species, space or time.",
"Since the desire to exist has always been present, our tendencies cannot have had any beginning.",
"Our subconscious tendencies depend upon cause and effect. They have their basis in the mind, and they are stimulated by the sense-objects. If all these are removed, the tendencies are destroyed.",
"There is the form and expression we call 'past,' and the form and expression we call 'future'; both exist within the object, at all times. Form and expression vary according to time -- past, present or future.",
"They are either manifest or subtle, according to the nature of the gunas.",
"Since the gunas work together within every change of form and expression, there is a unity in all things.",
"The same object is perceived in different ways by different minds. Therefore the mind must be other than object.",
"The object cannot be said to be dependent on the perception of a single mind. For, if this were the case, the object could be said to be non-existent when that single mind was not perceiving it.",
"An object is known or unknown, depending upon the moods of the mind.",
"Because the Atman, the Lord of the mind, is unchangeable, the mind's fluctuations are always known to it.",
"The mind is not self-luminous, since it is an object of perception.",
"And since it cannot perceive both subject and object simultaneously.",
"If one postulates a second mind to perceive the first, then one would have to postulate an infinite number of minds; and this would cause confusion of memory.",
"The pure  consciousness of the Atman is unchangeable. As the reflection of its consciousness falls upon the mind, the mind takes the form of the Atman and appears to be conscious.",
"The mind is able to perceive because it reflects both the Atman and the objects of perception.",
"Though the mind has innumerable impressions and desires, it acts only to serve another, the Atman; for being a compound substance, it cannot act independently, and for its own sake.",
"The man of discrimination ceases to regard the mind as the Atman.",
"When the mind is bent on the practice of discrimination, it moves toward liberation.",
"Distractions due to past impressions may arise if the mind relaxes its discrimination, even a little.",
"They may be overcome in the same manner as the obstacles to enlightenment.",
"He who remains undistracted even when he is in possession of all the psychic powers, achieves, as the result of perfect discrimination, that samadhi which is called the 'cloud of virtue.'",
"Thence come cessation of ignorance, the cause of suffering, and freedom from the power of karma.",
"Then the whole universe, with all its objects of sense-knowledge, becomes as nothing in comparison to that infinite knowledge which is free from all obstructions and impurities.",
"Then the sequence of mutations of the gunas comes to an end, for they have fulfilled their purpose.",
"This is the sequence of the mutations which take place at every moment, but which are only perceived at the end of a series.",
"Since the gunas no longer have any purpose to serve for the Atman, they resolve themselves into Prakriti. This is liberation. The Atman shines forth in its own pristine nature, as pure consciousness.",

"Here begins the authoritative instruction on Yoga.",
"Yoga is the ability to direct the mind exclusively toward an object and sustain that direction without any distractions.",
"Then the ability to understand the object fully and correctly is apparent.",
"The ability to understand the object is simply replaced by the mind's conception of that object or by a total lack of comprehension.",
"There are five activities of the mind. Each of them can be beneficial and each can cause problems.",
"The five activities are comprehension, misapprehension, imagination, deep sleep, and memory.",
"Comprehension is based on direct observation of the object, inference, and reference to reliable authorities.",
"Misapprehension is that comprehension that is taken to be correct until more favorable conditions reveal the actual nature of the object.",
"Imagination is the comprehension of an object based only on words and expressions, even though the object is absent.",
"Deep sleep is when the mind is overcome with heaviness and no other activities are present.",
"Memory is the mental retention of a conscious experience.",
"The mind can reach the state of Yoga through practice and detachment.",
"Practice is basically the correct effort required to move toward, reach, and maintain the state of Yoga.",
"It is only when the correct practice is followed for a long time, without interruptions and with a quality of positive attitude and eagerness, that it can succeed.",
"At the highest level there is an absence of any cravings, either for the fulfillment of the senses or for extraordinary experiences.",
"When an individual has achieved complete understanding of his true self, he will no longer be disturbed by the distracting influences within and around him.",
"Then the object is gradually understood fully. At first it is at a more superficial level. In time, comprehension becomes deeper. And finally it is total. There is pure joy in reaching such a depth of understanding. For then the individual is so much at one with the object that he is oblivious to his surroundings.",
"The usual mental disturbances are absent. However, memories of the past continue.",
"There will be some who are born in a state of Yoga. They need not practice or discipline themselves.",
"Through faith, which will give sufficient energy to achieve success against all odds, direction will be maintained. The realization of the goal of Yoga is a matter of time.",
"The more intense the faith and the effort, the closer the goal.",
"Inevitably the depth of faith varies with different individuals and at different times with the same individual. The results will reflect these variations.",
"Offering regular prayers to God with a feeling of submission to his power, surely enables the state of Yoga to be achieved.",
"God is the Supreme Being whose actions are never based on misapprehension.",
"He knows everything there is to be known.",
"God is eternal. In fact he is the ultimate teacher. He is the source of guidance for all teachers: past, present, and future.",
"In the way most appropriate to the qualities of God.",
"In order to relate to God it is necessary to regularly address him properly and reflect on his qualities.",
"The individual will in time perceive his true nature. He will not be disturbed by any interruptions that may arise in his journey to the state of Yoga.",
"There are nine types of interruptions to developing mental clarity: illness, mental stagnation, doubts, lack of foresight, fatigue, overindulgence, illusions about one's true state of mind, lack of perseverance, and regression. They are obstacles because they create mental disturbances and encourage distractions.",
"All these interruptions produce one or more of the following symptoms: mental discomfort, negative thinking, the inability to be at ease in different body postures, and difficulty in controlling one's breath.",
"If one can select an appropriate means to steady the mind and practice this, whatever the provocations, the interruptions cannot take root.",
"In daily life we see people around who are happier than we are, people who are less happy. Some may be doing praiseworthy things and others causing problems. Whatever may be our usual attitude toward such people and their actions, if we can be pleased with others who are happier than ourselves, compassionate toward those who are unhappy, joyful with those doing praiseworthy things, and remain undisturbed by the errors of others, our mind will be very tranquil.",
"The practice of breathing exercises involving extended exhalation might be helpful.",
"By regular inquiry into the role of the senses we can reduce mental distortions.",
"When we inquire into what life is and what keeps us alive, we may find some solace for our mental distractions.",
"When we are confronted with problems, the counsel of someone who has mastered similar problems can be a great help.",
"Inquiry into dreams and sleep and our experiences during or around these states can help to clarify some of our problems.",
"Any inquiry of interest can calm the mind.",
"When one reaches this state, nothing is beyond comprehension. The mind can follow and help understand the simple and the complex, the infinite and the infinitesimal, the perceptible and the imperceptible.",
"When the mind is free from distraction, it is possible for all the mental processes to be involved in the object of inquiry. As one remains in this state, gradually one becomes totally immersed in the object. The mind then, like a flawless diamond, reflects only the features of the object and nothing else.",
"Initially, because of our past experiences and ideas, our understanding of the object is distorted. Everything that has been heard, read, or felt may interfere with our perception.",
"When the direction of the mind toward the object is sustained, the ideas and memories of the past gradually recede. The mind becomes crystal clear and one with the object. At this moment there is no feeling of oneself. This is pure perception.",
"This process is possible with any type of object, at any level of perception, whether superficial and general or in-depth and specific.",
"Except that the mind cannot comprehend the very source of perception within us, its objects can be unlimited.",
"All these processes of directing the mind involve an object of inquiry.",
"Then the individual begins to truly know himself.",
"Then, what he sees and shares with others is free from error.",
"His knowledge is no longer based on memory of inference. It is spontaneous, direct, and at both a level and an intensity that is beyond the ordinary.",
"As this newly acquired quality of the mind gradually strengthens, it dominates the other mental tendencies that are based on misapprehensions.",
"The mind reaches a state when it has no impressions of any sort. It is open, clear, simply transparent.",
],[
"The practice of Yoga must reduce both physical and mental impurities. It must develop our capacity for self-examination and help us to understand that, in the final analysis, we are not the masters of everything we do.",
"Then such practices will be certain to remove obstacles to clear perception.",
"The obstacles are misapprehensions, confused values, excessive attachments, unreasonable dislikes, and insecurity.",
"Misapprehension is the source of all the other obstacles. They need not appear simultaneously and their impact varies. Sometimes they are obscure and barely visible; at other times they are exposed and dominant.",
"Misapprehension leads to errors in comprehension of the character, origin, and effects of the objects perceived.",
"False identity results when we regard mental activity as the very source of perception.",
"Excessive attachment is based on the assumption that it will contribute to everlasting happiness.",
"Unreasonable dislikes are usually the result of painful experiences in the past connected with particular objects and situations.",
"Insecurity is the inborn feeling of anxiety for what is to come. It affects both the ignorant and the wise.",
"When the obstacles do not seem to be present, it is important to be vigilant.",
"Advance toward a state of reflection to reduce their impact and prevent them from taking over.",
"Our actions and their consequences are influenced by these obstacles. The consequences may or may not be evident at the time of the action.",
"As long as the obstacles prevail they will affect action in every respect: in its execution, its duration, and its consequences.",
"The consequences of an action will be painful or beneficial depending on whether the obstacles were present in the concept or implementation of the action.",
"Painful effects from any object or situation can be a result of one or more of the following: changes in the perceived object, the desire to repeat pleasurable experiences, and the strong effect of conditioning from the past. In addition, changes within the individual can be contributing factors.",
"Painful effects that are likely to occur should be anticipated and avoided.",
"The cause of actions that produce painful effects is the inability to distinguish what is perceived from what perceives.",
"All that is perceived includes not only the external objects but also the mind and the senses. Theyshare three qualities: heaviness, activity, and clarity. They have two types of effects; to expose the perceiver to their influences, or to provide the means to find the distinction between them and itself.",
"All that is perceived is related by the common sharing of the three qualities.",
"That which perceives is not subject to any variations. But, it always perceives through the mind.",
"All that can be perceived has but one purpose: to be perceived.",
"The existence of all objects of perception and their appearance is independent of the needs of the individual perceiver. They exist without individual reference, to cater for the different needs of different individuals.",
"All that is perceived whatever it is and whatever its effect may be on a particular individual, has but one ultimate purpose. That is to clarify the distinction between the external that is seen and the internal that sees.",
"The absence of clarity in distinguishing between what perceives and what is perceived is due to the accumulation of misapprehension.",
"As misapprehension is reduced there is a corresponding increase in clarity. This is the path to freedom.",
"Essentially the means must be directed toward developing clarity so that the distinction between the changing qualities of what is perceived and the unchanging quality of what perceives becomes evident.",
"The attainment of clarity is a gradual process.",
"The practice and inquiry into different components of Yoga gradually reduce the obstacles such as misapprehension. Then the lamp of perception brightens and the distinction between what perceives and what is perceived becomes more and more evident. Now everything can be understood without error.",
"There are eight components of Yoga. These are:",
"Yama comprises:",
"When the adoption of these attitudes in our environmental is beyond compromise, regardless of our social, cultural, intellectual or individual station, it approaches irreversibility.",
"Niyama comprises:",
"When these attitudes are questioned, self-reflection on the possible consequences of alternativeattitudes may help.",
"For example, a sudden desire to act harshly, or encourage or approve of harsh actions can be contained by reflecting on the harmful consequences. Often such actions are the results of lower instincts such as anger, possessiveness, or unsound judgment. Whether these actions are minor or major, reflection in a suitable atmosphere can contain our desires to act in this way.",
"The more considerate one is, the more one stimulates friendly feelings among all in one's presence.",
"One who shows a high degree of right communication will not fail in his actions.",
"One who is trustworthy, because he does not covet what belongs to others, naturally has everyone's confidence and everything is shared with him, however precious it might be.",
"At its best, moderation produces the highest individual quality.",
"One who is not greedy is secure. He has time to think deeply. His understanding of himself is complete.",
"When cleanliness is developed it reveals what needs to be constantly maintained and what is eternally clean. What decays is the external. What does not is deep within us.",
"In addition one becomes able to reflect on the very deep nature of our individual selves, including the source of perception, without being distracted by the senses and with freedom from misapprehension accumulated from the past.",
"The result of contentment is total happiness.",
"The removal of impurities allows the body to function more efficiently.",
"Study, when it is developed to the highest degree, brings one close to higher forces that promote understanding of the most complex.",
"Reverence to God promotes the ability to completely understand any object of choice.",
"Asana must have the dual qualities of alertness and relaxation.",
"These qualities can be achieved by recognizing and observing the reactions of the body and the breath to the various postures that comprise asana practice. Once known, these reactions can be controlled step-by-step.",
"When these principles are correctly followed, asana practice will help a person endure and even minimize the external influences on the body such as age, climate, diet, and work.",
"Pranayama is the conscious, deliberate regulation of the breath replacing unconscious patterns of breathing. It is possible only after a reasonable mastery of asana practice.",
"It involves the regulation of the exhalation, the inhalation, and the suspension of the breath. The regulation of these three processes is achieved by modulating their length and maintaining this modulation for a period of time, as well as directing the mind into the process. These components of breathing must be both long and uniform.",
"Then the breath transcends the level of the consciousness.",
"The regular practice of pranayama reduces the obstacles that inhibit clear perception.",
"And the mind is now prepared for the process of direction toward a chosen goal.",
"The restraint of senses occurs when the mind is able to remain in its chosen direction and the senses disregard the different objects around them and faithfully follow the direction of the mind.",
"Then the senses are mastered.",

"The mind has reached the ability to be directed [dharana] when direction toward a chosen object is possible in spite of many other potential objects within the reach of the individual.",
"Then the mental activities form an uninterrupted flow only in relation to this object.",
"Soon the individual is so much involved in the object that nothing except its comprehension is evident. It is as if the individual has lost his own identity. This is the complete integration with the object of understanding [samadhi].",
"When these processes are continuously and exclusively applied to the same object it is called samyama.",
"Samyama on a chosen object leads to a comprehensive knowledge of the object in all its aspects.",
"Samyama must be developed gradually.",
"Compared to the first five components of Yoga [sutra 2.29] the next three [sutras 3.1, 2, 3] are more intricate.",
"The state where the mind has no impressions of any sort and nothing is beyond its reach [nirbijah samadhi] is more intricate than the state of directing the mind towards an object [samadhi].",
"The mind is capable of having two states based on two distinct tendencies. These are distraction and attention. At any one moment, however, only one state prevails, and this state influences the individual's behavior, attitudes, and expressions.",
"By constant and uninterrupted practice the mind can remain in a state of attention for a long time.",
"The mind alternates between the possibility of intense concentration and a state where alternative objects can attract attention.",
"The mind reaches a stage where the link with the object is consistent and continuous. The distractions cease to appear.",
"As it has been established that the mind has different states [corresponding to which there arose different attitudes, possibilities, and behavior patterns in the individual] it can also be said that such changes can occur in all the objects of perception and in the senses. These changes can be at different levels and influenced by external forces such as time or our intelligence.",
"A substance contains all its characteristics and, depending on the particular form it takes, those characteristics conforming to that form will be apparent. But whatever the form, whatever the characteristics exhibited, there exists a base that comprises all characteristics. Some have appeared in the past, some are currently apparent, and others may reveal themselves in the future.",
"By changing the order or sequence of change, characteristics that are of one pattern can be modified to a different pattern",
"Samyama on the process of change, how it can be affected by time and other factors, develops knowledge of the past and the future.",
"Samyama on the interactions between language, ideas, and object is to examine the individual features of the objects, the means of describing them, and the ideas and their cultural influences in the minds of the describers. Through this, one can find the most accurate and effective way of communicating regardless of linguistic, cultural, and other barriers.",
"Samyama on one's tendencies and habits will lead one to their origins. Consequently one gains deep knowledge of one's past.",
"Samyama on the changes that arise in an individual's mind and their consequences develops in one the ability to acutely observe the state of mind of others.",
"No. The cause of the state of mind of one individual is beyond the scope of observation by another.",
"Samyama on the relationship between the features of the body and what affects them can give one the means to merge with one's surroundings in such a way that one's form is indistinguishable.",
"The results of actions may be immediate or delayed. Samyama on this can give one the ability to predict the course of future actions and even his own death.",
"Different qualities such as friendliness, compassion, and contentment can be inquired into through samyama. Thus, one can learn how to strengthen a chosen quality.",
"Samyama on the physical strength of an elephant can give one the strength of an elephant",
"Directing the mind to the life-force itself and sustaining that direction through samyama, results in the ability to observe fine subtleties and understand what is preventing deep observation.",
"Samyama on the sun gives wide knowledge of the planetary system and the cosmic regions.",
"Samyama on the moon gives a thorough knowledge of the position of the stars at different times.",
"Samyama on Polaris gives knowledge about the relative movements of the stars.",
"Samyama on the navel gives knowledge about the different organs of the body and their dispositions.",
"Using the throat as a point of inquiry for samyama provides an understanding of thirst and hunger. This enables one to control their extreme symptoms.",
"Samyama on the chest area and inquiry into the sensations felt there in different physical and mental states gives one the means to remain stable and calm even in very stressful situations.",
"Samyama on the source of high intelligence in an individual develops supernormal capabilities.",
"Anything can be understood. With each attempt fresh and spontaneous understanding arises.",
"Samyama on the heart will definitely reveal the qualities of the mind.",
"The mind, which is subject to change, and the Perceiver, which is not, are in proximity but are of distinct and different characters. When the mind is directed externally and acts mechanically toward objects there is either pleasure or pain. When at the appropriate time, however, an individual begins inquiry into the very nature of the link between the Perceiver and perception the mind is disconnected from external objects and there arises the understanding of the Perceiver itself.",
"Then one begins to acquire extraordinary capacities for perception.",
"For an individual who may revert to a state of distraction, this extraordinary knowledge and the capabilities acquired through samyama are worth possessing. But for one who seeks nothing less than a sustained state of Yoga the results of samyama are obstacles in themselves.",
"By inquiring into the cause of this rigid situation binding the mind to the individual and examining the means of relaxing this rigidity there is great potential for an individual to reach beyond the confines of himself.",
"By mastering the forces that transmit sensations from the body to the mind it is possible to master the external stimuli. For instance, one can tolerate water of any temperature or the effects of thorns or one can walk on unstable surfaces and even feel as light as a balloon.",
"By mastering samana one can experience sensations of excessive heat.",
"Samyama on the relationship between the sense of hearing and space develops an extraordinary sense of hearing.",
"By samyama on the relationship between the body and space, and examining the properties of objects that can float such as cotton fluff, the knowledge to move about in space can be achieved.",
"By examining these phenomena and developing conditions when the mind does not confuse perception, there arises an extraordinary faculty with which one can probe other minds. In addition the clouds that obscure correct perception are minimized.",
"Samyama on the origin of matter in all its forms, appearances, and uses can develop into mastery of the elements.",
"When the elements are mastered one is no longer disturbed by them. The body reaches perfection and extraordinary capabilities become possible.",
"Perfection in the body means good features, attractiveness to others, physical firmness, and unusual physical strength.",
"Mastery over the senses is achieved through samyama on the ability of the senses to observe their respective objects, how such objects are understood, how the individual identifies with the object, how the object, the senses, the mind, and the Perceiver are interrelated, and what results from such perception.",
"Then the response of the senses will be as swift as that of the mind. They will perceive acutely and the individual will have the capacity to influence the characteristics of the elements.",
"When there is clear understanding of the difference between the Perceiver and the mind, all the various states of mind and what affects them become known. Then, the mind becomes a perfect instrument for the flawless perception of everything that need be known.",
"Freedom, the last goal of Yoga, is attained only when the desire to acquire extraordinary knowledge is rejected and the source of obstacles is completely controlled.",
"The temptation to accept the respectful status as a consequence of acquiring knowledge through samyama should be restrained. Otherwise, one is led to the same unpleasant consequences that arise from all obstacles to Yoga.",
"Samyama on time and its sequence brings about absolute clarity.",
"This clarity makes it possible to distinguish objects even when the distinction is not apparently clear. Apparent similarity should not deter one from the distinct perception of a chosen object.",
"Such clarity is not exclusive of any object, any particular situation, or any moment. It is not the result of sequential logic. It is immediate, spontaneous, and total.",
"Freedom is when the mind has complete identity with the Perceiver.",
"sattva purusayoh suddhi samye kaivalyam iti",
],[
"Exceptional mental capabilities may be achieved by: genetic inheritance, the use of herbs as prescribed in the Vedas, reciting incantations, rigorous austerities, and through that state of mind that remains with its object without distractions [samadhi].",
"Change from one set of characteristics to another is essentially an adjustment of the basic qualities of matter.",
"But such intelligence can only remove obstacles that obstruct certain changes. Its role is no more than that of a farmer who cuts a dam to allow water to flow into the field where it is needed.",
"With exceptional mental faculties an individual can influence the mental state of other beings.",
"This influence also depends on the state of the recipient.",
"Influence on another by one whose mind is in a state of dhyana can never increase anxiety or other obstacles. In fact, they are reduced.",
"And they act without any motivation while others who also have exceptional capabilities act with some motivation or other.",
"Because the tendency of the mind to act on the basis of the five obstacles, such as misapprehension, has not been erased, they will surface in the future to produce their unpleasant consequences.",
"Memory and latent impressions are strongly linked. This link remains even if there is an interval of time, place, or context between similar actions.",
"There is a strong desire for immortality in all men at all times. Thus these impressions cannot be ascribed to any time.",
"These tendencies are both maintained and sustained by misapprehensions, external stimuli, attachment to the fruits of actions, and the quality of mind that promotes hyperactivity. Reduction of these automatically makes the undesirable impressions ineffective.",
"The substance of what has disappeared as well as what may appear always exists. Whether or not they are evident depends upon the direction of change.",
"Whether or not particular characteristics appear depends on the mutations of the three qualities.",
"The characteristics of a substance at one moment in time is in fact a single change in these qualities.",
"The characteristics of an object appear differently, depending upon the different mental states of the observer.",
"If the object were indeed the conception of a particular individual's mind, then in the absence of his perception, would it exist?",
"Whether an object is perceived or not depends on its accessibility as well as the individual's motivation.",
"Mental activities are always known to the Perceiver that is nonchanging and master of the mind.",
"In addition, the mind is a part of what is perceived and has no power of its own to perceive. ",
"The premise that the mind can play two roles is untenable because it cannot simultaneously fabricate and see what it fabricates.",
"In an individual with such a series of minds of momentary existence there would be disorder and the difficulty of maintaining consistency of memory.",
"When the mind is not linked to external objects and it does not respect an external form to the Perceiver, then it takes the form of the Perceiver itself.",
"Thus the mind serves a dual purpose. It serves the Perceiver by presenting the external to it. It also repects [sic] or presents the Perceiver to itself for its own enlightenment.",
"Even though the mind has accumulated various impressions of different types it is always at the disposal of the Perceiver. This is because the mind cannot function without the power of the Perceiver.",
"A person of extraordinary clarity is one who is free from the desire to know the nature of the Perceiver.",
"And their clarity takes them to their only concern; to reach and remain in a state of freedom.",
"In the unlikely possibility of distraction from this aim, disturbing past impressions are able to surface.",
"One must never accommodate even small errors because they are as detrimental as the five obstacles.",
"There arises a state of mind full of clarity concerning all things at all times. It is like a rainfall of pure clarity.",
"This is, indeed, the state free from actions based on the five obstacles.",
"When the mind is free from the clouds that prevent perception, all is known, there is nothing to be known.",
"The three basic qualities cease to follow the sequence of alternating pain and pleasure.",
"A sequence is the replacement of one characteristic by one that follows it. This is linked to moment. A replacement of characteristics is also the basis of moment.",
"When the highest purpose of life is achieved the three basic qualities do not excite responses in the mind. That is freedom. In other words, the Perceiver is no longer colored by the mind.",
