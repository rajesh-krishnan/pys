"1. May the replendant lord or Serpents, the  many-hooded One, protect us, -- He administering Yoga, while himself equipped with it, having a body of pure white, delighting in serpentine body, the fountain-head of all wisdom, whose troubles are at an end, holding, as he does, terrific poison, -- One who having renounced his original body, is born in this world for the manifold benefits of human-kind.  <p> Sutra 1: Now (begins) the exposition of Yoga.  <p> Atha denotes Adhikara i. e. the commencement of a topic. (The meaning of the Sutra being:) The Science of the instruction of Yoga is is to be understood to have begun (here).  <p> Yoga is Samadhi, Meditation; but (this meditation) is a property of the internal organ, common to all its various stages. The Stages or States of the internal organ are: (l) The Fickle (Kshipta), (2) The Infatuated (Yugdha), (3) Voluptuous or Distracted (Vikshipta) (4) The One-Pointed (Ekagra), and (5) The Controlled (Niruddha). From among these, the meditation in the Voluptuous or Distracted state of the internal organ, being subordinate to the voluptuousness or distraction, has no place on the side of Yoga (proper). That (meditation) however which belongs to the one-pointed internal organ, enlightening the true and agreeable object, detroying the troubles, loosening bonds of action, and bringing one face to face with Control proper--such meditation is the Conscious (Samprajnata) Yoga. This is attended by Argumentation, Deliberation, Joy and Egoism.  The entire subjugation of all the functions (of the internal organ) constitutes what is called Unconscious or Abstract (Asamprajnata) Yoga. ",
"2. In order to define the Yoga above mentioned we see the next aphorism--<p>Sutra 2: Yoga is the suppression of the functions of the internal organ. <p> Since the word all does not appear before functions, Conscious or Concrete meditation also becomes included in the name yoga.  The internal organ is made up of three attributes,-- in as much as it has the characters of truth, activity and inertia.  Sattwa in the form of the internal organ. when intermixed with Rajas and Tamas comes to be attached to power the objects (of sense). Sattwa again, when mixed up with Tamas, tends towards sin, ignorance, non-dispassion (or attachment) and non-power (or weakness). The same Sattwa lastly everywhere shining, on having its covering of illusion removed, when tinged by Rajas, tends towards virtue. knowledge, dispassion and pwer. The same Sattwa however, when passed beyond the taint of Rajas, fixed in its own form, consisting purely of discriminative knowledge of Matter and Spirit, tends towards contemplation, called Cloud of Virtue. This is what is called Supreme Contemplation by the Dhyanis.  The Sentient Faculty (or Intelligence proper), the Unchanging and the Immobile--having the objects presented to Itself, is pure and endless; and It consists in the attribute of Sattwa. For this reason discriminative knowledge is contrary to this (since such is modifiable, mobile, non-intelligent, finite and impure). <p> For this reason, the internal organ--having become indifferent to the sentient faculty, (naturally) suppresses the discriminative knowledge; When in this condition, it centres itself in mere residuum (Sanskara). This is Seedless Meditation-- and because nothing else is cognised in this state, therefore it is called Unconscious or Abstract (asamprajnata). <p> Thus is Yoga -- of the form of the suppression of the functions of the internal organ -- two-fold. ",
"3. The internal organ being in that condition -- and as such there being a complete absence of objects,--what is the character of the Purusha--being as it is of the nature of the cognition of Buddhi (the internal organ)? <p> Sutra 3: Then there is an abiding of the spectator in its own form.  <p> The abiding in its own form is then, as in beatitude (identical with) the sentient faculty. In the (ordinary) waking state the sentient faculty though being the same, is not (exactly) the same.  ",
"4. How then ? On account of the objects having ben presented,-- <p>Sutra 4: At other times, conformity to the functions.  <p> In the waking state the functions of the Purusha are, indentical with those of the internal organ. Hence the Sutra: Perception is one, and cognition or knowledge Perception. <p> The internal organ, like the affecting by mere proximity, being the object of perception, becomes the self of the Purusha, the Lord. Therefore the cause of the Purusha's perception of the functions of the internal organ is its eternal connection therewith. ",
"5. The internal organ being manifold, the objects of suppression, <p> Sutra 5: the functions, are fivefold, painful (and) non-painful.  <p> The painful are causs of pain--the fruitful ground for the aggregate of the karmic residua. And the non-painful have knowledge for their object, and are opposed to the action of the Attributes. The non-painful ones falling in the current of the painful ones, though (occurring within two painful ones, are still non-painful; similarly are the painful ones, occurring among non-painful ones, called painful.  <p> Residua of one kind are brought about by the functions of the same kind, and also the functions by the residua--this wheel of function and residua is incessantly revolving.  <p> Thus the internal organ, having attained to this condition, and its action having ended, stands equal to the Spirit, or is dissolved.",
"6. These functions being painful, and non-painful are five-fold: <p> Sutra 6: Right Notion, Misconception, Fancy, Sleep and Memory.",
"7. Among these (i.e. the five-fold functions of the internal organ just named) -- <p>Sutra 7: Perception, Inference, Testimony are the right Notions. <p> The internal organ being affected by the external object through the path-way the sense-organs, there arises a functioning thereof, having the aforesaid external thing for its object, and having as its principal concern the ascertainment of a certain specific aspect of the object, which naturally partakes of the generic as well as of the specific. Such a function constitutes the Right Notion, called Perception. The effect of this Right Notion is the cognition of the function of the internal organ--the cognition belonging to the Spirit, and being co-ordinate or identical (with the Buddhi). The Spirit is the joint-cogniser With the internal organ. This we explain later on.  <p> Of the object of inference there is a certain relationship which is to all homogenous objects, and dissociated from the heterogeneous ones; the function, having this relation for its object, concerned chiefly with the ascertainment of the generic (character of things), is Inference. As for example-- The planets have motion, because they approach different regions, like Chaitra;--the Vindhya Mountain having no such approach, has no motion. <p> A certain object, having been either perceived or inferred by an anthoritative person, is verbally expressed for the sake of transferring that cognition to another person. The function having, through words, such a thing for its object, is Testimony for the listener. That Testimony fails which is on the assertion of an untrustworthy speaker, who has neither seen nor inferred an object truly. If however, the original speaker has seen and inferred an object truly, then the testimony becomes infallible. ",
"8. Sutra 8: Misconception is false notion, abiding in a form, which is that (of the object). <p> This is not right notion; because, it is always set aside by right notion, which has for its object something really existing in the external world. It has been always seen that a right notion always sets aside a wrong one; e.g. the perception of the double moon is set aside by the subsequentive of the single moon. <p> It is this that constitudes the five-fold Illusion or Nescience :- (1) Ignorance, (2) Egotism, (3) Attachment, (4) Envy, and (5) Tenacity of life--the five Troubles. These five have also the respective names of: (1) Tamas (Darkness), (2) Moha (Illusion) (3) Mohamoha (Great Illusion), (4) (Timisra) and (5) Andhatamisra (Blinding darkness). This will be defined in the impurities of the internal organ. ",
"9. Sutra 9: Fancy is (a notion) founded on knowledge conveyed by words, but of which there is no object (corresponding in reality). <p> This cannot included either within Right Notion, or within Misconception. Because though it has got no object corresponding in reality, yet its acceptance in usage is seen to be based on the power of the knowledge of words. As for example, the assertion--Intelligence is the form of the Spirit. If the Spirit is nothing more than intelligence, then what would be named and qualified by what? It is only when there is such nomination or qualification that we have the fanction.--e.g. Chaitra's cow. Similarly--The Spirit, having all objective properties alienated from it, is devoid of action; and--Bana sits, will sit, and sat. With regard to absence of motion, however, only the meaning of the root is signified. Similarly again, Spirit has the property of non-production, --qualifying adjunct bere implying merely the negation of production, and not any property belonging to the Spirit: and for this reason, (in the example given) the qualification is a faniced one, on the said usage is based.",
"10. Sutra 10: Sleep is the function having for its object the conception of negation. <p> And this is a particular kind of conception, because it is recalled in the waking state. How? In this manner: (l) have slept well; my happy mind brightens my intellect.  (2) I have slept ill; my mind wandering listlessly, has become worthless. (3) I have slept like of log of wood; my limbs are heavy; and my tired mind is lazy and seems to be absent.  This recalling by a person on waking would not have been, if there were no knowledge of any conception; the reminiscences connected with sleep could not have the conception for their object. Therefore Sleep is a particular conception; and this too, like all other conceptions, ought to be suppressed during meditation. ",
"11. Sutra 11: Memory is the non-relinquishment of an object that has ben cognised. <p> Does the internal organ remember the cognition, or the object? The cognition,--coloured by the cognised (object), and (as such) manifesting (or illuminating) the forms of both the cognised (object) and the cognition,-- produces an impression, (samskara) of the same character. And this impresssion, being of the same form as its cause, brings about a recollection of the same character, partaking of both the cognised and the cognition. <p> Of these, the cognition has got the form of the cognition for its principal factor; and Memory or Recollection has got the form of the cognised for its precedent. <p> This Memory is two-fold -- (1) One whose object to be remembered is assumed, and (2) the other whose object is not assumed. During a dream we have the former, whereas in the waking state, we have the latter. <p> All kinds of Memory owe their existence to the prior experience of Right Notion, Misconception, Fancy, Sleep and Memory. <p> All these functions are constituted by pleasure, pain and illusion. These three will be explained under Klesa.  Attachment belongs to pleasure and envy to pain; while illusion is ignorance. All these functions are to be suppressed --their suppression leading to one of the two sorts of Meditation. ",
"12. What is the means for the suppression of these? <p> Sutra 12: By Exercise and Dispassion, (follows) their suppresion. <p> The river of the internal flows both ways.  It flows for good, and it flows for evil. That which has its mouth at Isolation, and its bottom in Discrimination, flows for good. Where-as the one having its mouth at Rebirth and its bottom in Non-discrimination, flows for evil.  Among these, the flow of (worldly) objects is thinned by Dispassion; and the flow of discrimination is opend by the Exercise of discriminative vision. Thus we see that the suppression of the functions of the internal organ is dependent upon both of these. <p>",
"13.  Sutra 13: Exercise is the effort towards quietness.<p> Quietness (Sthiti) is the calm flov of the internal organ clear of its functionings. And Exercise consists in an effort for this i.e. an undaunted courageous and spirited endeavour, consisting in acting upto the means of attaining the aforesaid calmness.",
"14. Sutra 14: But it is of firm ground when attended to for a long time unremittingly and with proper devotion. <p> Being attended to for a long time, and unremittingly --and brought about by penance, celibacy, knowledge and faith, and as such endowed with proper devotion-it becomes steadfast; that is to say, its object is not then easily suppressed by the impresions of the agitative stage. ",
"15. Sutra 15: Dispassion is the (Vashikarasanjna) Consciousness of being the subjugator, belonging to one who is devoid of any thirst for perceptible and scriptural objects. <p> One becomes devoid of any desire for the temporal perceptible objects--women, drink and wealth,--and for the scriptural objects, attainment of heaven, disembodiment, dissolution in Nature,--then his internal organ, noticing the objective discrepancies even in the relation of celestial and terrestrial objects, attains to the name of Vashikaranasanjna which, on the strength of the recognition of discrepancies, is of the nature of anaabhoga, i.e., free from faults of attachment.  (And this Vashikarasanjna or consciousness of being the subjugator, is Dispassion.) ",
"16. Sutra 16: Indifference to the attributes, being conducive to the knowledge of the Spirit, is the highest ( form of it).<p> (1) The agent who recognises discrepancies in temporal and spiritual objects, and hence becomes dispassionate, and (2) one whose internal organ has been calmed by supreme discrimination due to the purity of spiritual exercise, and who has hence detached from the attributes constituting the manifested and the unmanifested forms of matter;--these two indicate the two kinds of Dispassion.  Of these, the latter is the sole effalgence of wisdom, on the appearance of which, the agent equipped with knowledge, reflects thus : I have attained to what I had to attain,-- the objects to be destroyed, the troubles, have been destroyed,--cut off is the thickly interwoven chain of metemspychosis, whose unbroken range causes the death of the born and the birth of the dead. <p> Dispasion is the highest stage of knowledge; and the necessary concomittant of this alone, is Isolation.",
"17.  When the agent has suppressed his internal organ through the two means (just described), how can the meditation to said to be  Conscious?<p> Sutra 17: Conscious, because attended with the forms of argumentation, deliberation, joy, and egoism. <p> Argumentation is the gross perception of the internal organ, with regard to its object; whereas (2) Deliberation is subtle in its nature. (3) Joy is delight. (4) Egoism is the partial cognition of identity. <p> Of these, the first followed by the other four constitutes the Argumentative Meditation ; the second, devoid of Argumentation, the Deliberative; the third without Deliberation the Joyful. The fourth without this, is purely Egoistic. All these forms of meditation are concrete. ",
"18. Now, what is the nature of Unconscious or Abstract meditation and what are the means to it? <p>Sutra 18:  The other, preceded by the practice of the cause of suspension, is that in which the residua alone remain behind. <p> When all the functions have been suspended and the residua alone remain behind, then we have a supression of the internal organ, which constitutes (a form of) meditation, called the Unconscious or Abstract. <p> Of this the means is the highest form of Dispassion (see above). And, because an exercise based on an object would not be capable or being fit for ita accompaniment, therefore the objectless (or immaterial) cause of suspension is made tbe basis here: and this cause is devoid of any material object. (Conse quently) the internal organ, preceded by the practice thereof, becomes immaterial, as if non-existing. This Immaterial or seedless meditation is what is called the Unconscious or the Abstract. ",
"19. This ( meditation ) is of two kinds-- The Bhavapratyaya (caused by the world) and the Upaayapratyaya (caused by the means). Of these the latter belongs to the Yogis. <p> Sutra 19: The world-caused belongs to the Disembodied aud the to the Resolved-into-Nature.<p> To the Disembodied--i.e. the celestial beings-- belongs the World-caused (Bhavapratyaya). These (beings),-- experiencing isolation as it were, by means of their internal organs aided by their residua alone,--carry over the residual fructifications which are cognate therewith.  Similarly the Resolved-into-Nature experience isolation as it were, on the dissolution into Nature of the interunl organ in its full activity; (and this experience continues only) so long as the internal organ, by its inherent authority does not return (to its work).",
"20. Sutra 20: Of others, preceded by faith, energy, memory, meditation and discrimination. <p> To the yogis belongs the Means-caused (Upaayapratyaya).  Faith, confidence of the mind like the loving mother, sustains the Yogi. Energy accrues to an agent endued with faith and desirous of discrimination; and on the energetic attends Memory; on this the mind rests peacefally in contemplation; and to one of calm mind comes Discri mination, by means of which he comes to recognise things in their true colours, By constant practice of this, and by means of Dispassion with regard thereto, is brought about Unconscious or Abstract Meiitation. <p> The nine yogis are such as have their means mild, moderate and excessive. E.g. (1) One of mild means, (2) Of moderate means, and (3) Of excessive means; of these again the first is of three kinds: (l) The mildly-dispassionate, (2) the moderately-dispassionate and (3) the ardently-dispassionate.  There are similar divisions of the moderate means and the excessive means. ",
"21. From among these, for those of excessive means (is laid down) ...<p> Sutra 21: ... the ardently dispassionate, proximate <p> ...  is the accomplishment of meditation, as well as its end.  ",
"22. Sutra 22: A further distinction, on account of the mild, the moderate and the excessive. <p> There is a distinction farther than this, such as: (1) The midley-ardent, (2) the moderately-ardent, and (3) the excessively-ardent. On account of this distinction, the accomplishment of meditation and its ends, is near to one of excessive means when mildly-ardently-dispassionate, nearer to him when moderately-ardently-dispassionate, and nearest to him when excessively-ardently-dispassionate.",
"23. Is the extreme proximity of meditation due to this (above mentioned) cause alone? or is there any Other means to its attainment? <p> Sutra 23: Or by devotion to God. <p> The Supreme Gcd, being attracted by the devotion (of the yogi) favours him by mere prescience. And from this prescience also accrues to the agent, the accomplishment of meditation and its ends. ",
"24. Who is this God, distinct from Nature and Spirit?<p> Sutra 24: God is a distinct spirit, untouched by affictions, actions, deserts and impressions. <p> Afflictions,--Ignorance adn the rest. Actions, good and evil,--the effects of these are the Deserts,--and desires in accordance with these, are the Impressions; though these reside in the internal organ, yet they are attributed to the Spirit, who is the experiencer of their results; just as defeat or victory really belonging to the soldiers, is attributed to their leader. That Spirit, who is untouched by such exprience, is God. <p> Though there are many master-adepts who have attained to such Isolation,--(yet) such have attained to Isolation after having cut off the three bondages; whereas the connection of God with these has neither been nor ever will be. We do not know of preceding bondage of God, as we do of the emancipated; nor is any future bondage possible for God, as it is for the Resolved-in-nature. He is ever Isolated and ever Supreme. <p> This eternal Supremacy of God, due to supreme goodness,--has it any proof, or it is incapable of proof?<p> Its proof lies in the Scripture.<p> What is the proof for this Scripture?<p> It lies in its supreme goodness. The connection between these two,--Scripture and its supreme character, resident as they are in God's Buddhi,--is eternal. From Scripture, it comes to this: that God is ever the Lord and ever emancipated.<p> And this supremacy of His is free from quality or excess, because it is never exceeded by any other supremacy; whatever should exceed it, would become that itself. Hence wherever there is the final stage of supremacy, that is God. <p> Nor is there any supremancy equal to it. Because when there are two things equally supreme (contending) with regard to a desired object, (one saying) may this be new and (the other contending) may this be old--then (in such a case) only one can be fulfilled, and as such there would result the resistence of the will of another, which would imply the lesser character of his supremacy. And further, to two equal persons cannot belong the simultaneous accomplishment of the desired object,--the objects being contradictory. Therefore He whose supremacy is free from from equality and excess, is God; and He is a distinct Spirit. <p>",
"25. And further,...<p> 8utra 25: In Him is the highest limit of the seed of omniscience.<p> The seed of omniscience is the cognition of the parvitude (or smallness) and magnitude (or largeness) of the perception of supersensorious objects, past, present and future, individually as well as collectively. And that person is omniscient in who this seed has grown to its utmost extent. There is a gradual progress of the seed of omniscience because it has various degrees, like Dimension (parimaana). That person in whom wisdom attains its limit, is omniscient; and this is a particular Spirit. <p> The above inference, ending in only a general conclusion, is nor capable of denoting any particular being; consequently the knowledge of particular names is to be looked for in the Scripture. <p> For God, though there is no selfish motive, yet there is the motive of mercy for the creatures,-- (being of the form) 'By mans or instructions in wisdom and virtue, I shall rescue all transmigratory spirits, at the periodical and the final dissolution'.  As is declared: 'The first Knower, Lord and Great Sage (Kapila), with a view to creation, in his mercy, taught the Science to the enquiring Asuri.'",
"26. And such a one is --<p> Sutra 26: the Greatest of even the earliest ones, because unconditioned by time.<p> The early great ones are all conditioned by time for whom time does note appear as a condition, is the instructor and hence the greatest of even the earlier ones; and as (the existence of such a one) is established, in this cycle, by superiority, so should it be understood with reference to the past cycles also.",
"27. Sutra 27: His indicator is the Pranava.<p> God is the indicated of the Pranava.<p> Is denotation of it convention, or is it inherent in it, like the light or the lamp?  <p> The relation of this indicated (the God) with the indicator (the pranava) is inherent. Convention due to God only represents objects, already existing; as for example, the natural relation of the father and son is expressed by convention as 'This is the Father, and that his son.' In other cycles also, convention is dependent upon the (inherent) faculties of the indiator and the indicated. The masters of scripture declare the relation of word and meaning to be eternal because of the eternal character of universal agreement (in convention). ",
"28. Sutra 28: Its repeition, and the contemplation of its meaning.<p> The repetition of the Pranava and the contemplation of its denotation--God. In its manner then the internal organ of the yogi, who repeats the pranava and reflects on its meaning, becomes concentrated; as is declared: 'After repetition, one should have recourse to meditation ; and after meditation, again he should take to repetition. Through perfection in repetition and meditation the supreme spirit lightens.' (Vishnu Purana)",
"29. What more accrues to him?<p> Sutra 29: Hence the cognition of reversed perception and absence of obstacles.  <p> All the obtacles--disease and the rest-- cease to exist, by virtue of devotion to God. And to him belongs the perception of his real character. 'As God is a Spirit, pure, blissful, isolated and free from troubles,--so also is this spirit, the counter-cogniser of Buddhi (intellect'--such being the recognition.",
"30. Sutra 30: Disease, Languor, Doubt, Carelessness, Sloth, Worldly-mindedness, Mistaken Notions, Missing the Point, and Instability;--these causing the distraction of the internal organ are the obstacles.<p> The obtacles, the distractors of the internal organ are nine. These are possible only in the company of the functions of the internal organ, which latter too are not possible without these. Disease--disorder of the humours, fluids and the senses. Languor--incapability of the internal organ to work. Doubt--cognition touching both ends of a subject--'this may be, this may not be'. Carelessness-- non-reflection on the means of meditation. Sloth-- Inactivity of the body and mind, due to lethargy. Worldly-mindedness-- desire with regard to the connection of the internal organ with sensorious objects. Mistaken Notions-- contrary or false cognition. Missing the Point--non-acquirement of the state of meditation. Instability--the unfixed character of the internal organ with regard to the stages already acquired. The mind would become steady for the accomplishment of meditation.<p> These the distractors of the internal organ, the mind impurities of meditation, also called the Enemies and obstacles of meditation.", 
"31. Sutra 31: Pain, Irritation, Trembling, Inspiration and Expiration are the companions of distractions. <p> Pain--the natural, the terrestrial and the cellestial Pain is that, being struck by which living beings try for its extirpation. Irritation--agitation of the mind, due to non-fulfillment of desire. Trembling--that which shakes the body. Inspiration--in that breath which touches (draws) the external air; and Expiration is which expels the internal air. <p> These are the companions of distractions. These happen to those whose minds are distracted; and not to those whose minds are at peace.",
"32. Sutra 32: For their prevention, exercise on one principle. <p> One ought to apply the internal organ fixed upon one single principle, for the prevention of distraction. One whose internal organ consists in mere cognition based upon several objects, and transitory, such a one's internal organ can never concentrated, and as such must be distracted. If however it is drawn away from other objects, and fixed on any one object, then it concentrated, and hence not based on several objects. <p> One who thinks the internal organ to be concentrated when it is found to consist in an uninterrupted flow of similar cognitions,-- for him, if concentration is a property of the current of the internal organ, then (there is the objection that) such a current cannot be one, because it is momentary. If however the concentration be said to belong to the cognition, only so far as the current is concerned,--then (there is the objection that in that case, the whole of this (current), consisting either in the current of similar cognitions, or of dissimilar ones, would be fixed upon several objects, and as such concentrated; and as such there could never be any distraction of the internal organ. Therefore it mast be concluded that the internal organ is one, and has many objects. Again if by the one internal organ were brought about unconnected and heterogenous (or dissimilar) cognitions then, one cognition would remember the object perceived by another congition, and one would experience the effects of the karmic residua gathered by another cognition. Such a cognition, even if in any way fixed, would imply the rule of 'the cowdung and the milk- pudding.' (editor: i.e., the vulgar reasoning that the cowdung is the pudding, because both owe their existence to the cow).<p> And further, if the internal organ were different, then the (Banddha would fall into the danger of) having done away with the cognition of his self. How? 'I am touching what I had seen,' 'I am seeing what I had touched'--such a cognition is present to the agent as being identical, though the cognitions themselves are different. How would this consciouness of a single cognition, the cognition of the identical self,--existing in several and altogether dissimilar internal organs--rest itself upon a single conscious agent?  This consciousness of personal identity is quite perceptible to the agent; and certainly the force of perception is not affected by any other proof; for all other proofs owe their strength in usage to perception alone. <p> Therefore the internal organ is one, fixed upon various objects and is  steady.",
"33. Question. For some, this system lays down the purifier. Whence is this?<p> Sutra 33: The peacefulness of the internal organ through friendliness, compassion, complacency and indifference in regard to pleasure and pain, and virtue and vice.<p> One ought to bear friendship towards all the beings that may be enjoying pleasure; compassion towards the distressed; complacency towards the virtuous ; end indifference towards the vicious. To one who thus bears himself, accrues pure virtue; thence the internal organ becomes cheerful (peaceful); and being cheerful, it becomes concentrated and attains to steadiness.",
"34. Sutra 34: Or by the expulsion and retention of breath.<p> The throwing out of the internal air through the nostrils, by a special effort, is Expulsion; Retention is the regulation of breath. By these two means also is one to bring steadiness of the internal organ.",

"20. Sutra 20: But not along with its object, that not being the object.<p> The Yogi knows the mind of another, as attached to something; but he does not know 'it is attached to that particular object.' Because that which is the object of another's mind, is not the object of the Yogi's mind; it is only another's cognition (or mind) that is made the object of the mind or the Yogi.",
"21. Sutra 21: From Samyama with reference to the shape of the body, its visibility being suspended, and thus its connection with occular light being severed,--there is disappearance.<p> From the Sanyana with regard to the shape of the body, the visibility of the shape becomes suppressed; and on this suspension, the connection of the body with the light of (other people's) eyes ceases; and thence results the disappearance of the Yogi. The disappearance of sound and the rest are to be explained in the same manner.",
