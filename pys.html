"1. May the resplendent lord of Serpents, the many-hooded One, protect us,--He administering Yoga, while himself equipped with it, having a body of pure white, delighting in serpentine body, the fountain-head of all wisdom, whose troubles are at an end, holding, as he does, terrific poison, -- One who having renounced his original body, is born in this world for the manifold benefits of human-kind. <p><b>Sutra:</b> Now (begins) the exposition of Yoga. <p>Atha denotes Adhikara i. e. the commencement of a topic. (The meaning of the Sutra being:) The Science of the instruction of Yoga is to be understood to have begun (here). <p>Yoga is Samadhi, Meditation; but (this meditation) is a property of the internal organ, common to all its various stages. The Stages or States of the internal organ are: (l) The Fickle (Kshipta), (2) The Infatuated (Yugdha), (3) Voluptuous or Distracted (Vikshipta) (4) The One-Pointed (Ekagra), and (5) The Controlled (Niruddha). From among these, the meditation in the Voluptuous or Distracted state of the internal organ, being subordinate to the voluptuousness or distraction, has no place on the side of Yoga (proper). That (meditation) however which belongs to the one-pointed internal organ, enlightening the true and agreeable object, destroying the troubles, loosening bonds of action, and bringing one face to face with Control proper--such meditation is the Conscious (Samprajnata) Yoga. This is attended by Argumentation, Deliberation, Joy and Egoism. The entire subjugation of all the functions (of the internal organ) constitutes what is called Unconscious or Abstract (Asamprajnata) Yoga.",
"2. In order to define the Yoga above mentioned we see the next aphorism--<p><b>Sutra:</b> Yoga is the suppression of the functions of the internal organ.<p>Since the word all does not appear before functions, Conscious or Concrete meditation also becomes included in the name yoga. The internal organ is made up of three attributes,-- in as much as it has the characters of truth, activity and inertia. Sattva in the form of the internal organ. when intermixed with Rajas and Tamas comes to be attached to power the objects (of sense). Sattva again, when mixed up with Tamas, tends towards sin, ignorance, non-dispassion (or attachment) and non-power (or weakness). The same Sattva lastly everywhere shining, on having its covering of illusion removed, when tinged by Rajas, tends towards virtue. knowledge, dispassion and power. The same Sattva however, when passed beyond the taint of Rajas, fixed in its own form, consisting purely of discriminative knowledge of Matter and Spirit, tends towards contemplation, called Cloud of Virtue. This is what is called Supreme Contemplation by the Dhyanis. The Sentient Faculty (or Intelligence proper), the Unchanging and the Immobile--having the objects presented to Itself, is pure and endless; and It consists in the attribute of Sattva. For this reason discriminative knowledge is contrary to this (since such is modifiable, mobile, non-intelligent, finite and impure).<p>For this reason, the internal organ--having become indifferent to the sentient faculty, (naturally) suppresses the discriminative knowledge; When in this condition, it centres itself in mere residuum (Sanskara). This is Seedless Meditation-- and because nothing else is cognised in this state, therefore it is called Unconscious or Abstract (asamprajnata).<p>Thus is Yoga -- of the form of the suppression of the functions of the internal organ -- two-fold.",
"3. The internal organ being in that condition -- and as such there being a complete absence of objects,--what is the character of the Purusha--being as it is of the nature of the cognition of Buddhi (the internal organ)?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Then there is an abiding of the spectator in its own form.<p>The abiding in its own form is then, as in beatitude (identical with) the sentient faculty. In the (ordinary) waking state the sentient faculty though being the same, is not (exactly) the same.",
"4. How then? On account of the objects having been presented,--<p><b>Sutra:</b> At other times, conformity to the functions. <p>In the waking state the functions of the Purusha are, identical with those of the internal organ. Hence the Sutra: Perception is one, and cognition or knowledge Perception.<p>The internal organ, like the affecting by mere proximity, being the object of perception, becomes the self of the Purusha, the Lord. Therefore the cause of the Purusha's perception of the functions of the internal organ is its eternal connection therewith.",
"5. The internal organ being manifold, the objects of suppression,<p><b>Sutra:</b> the functions, are fivefold, painful (and) non-painful. <p>The painful are cause of pain--the fruitful ground for the aggregate of the karmic residua. And the non-painful have knowledge for their object, and are opposed to the action of the Attributes. The non-painful ones falling in the current of the painful ones, though (occurring within two painful ones, are still non-painful; similarly are the painful ones, occurring among non-painful ones, called painful. <p>Residua of one kind are brought about by the functions of the same kind, and also the functions by the residua--this wheel of function and residua is incessantly revolving. <p>Thus the internal organ, having attained to this condition, and its action having ended, stands equal to the Spirit, or is dissolved.",
"6. These functions being painful, and non-painful are five-fold:<p><b>Sutra:</b> Right Notion, Misconception, Fancy, Sleep and Memory.",
"7. Among these (i.e. the five-fold functions of the internal organ just named) --<p><b>Sutra:</b> Perception, Inference, Testimony are the right Notions.<p>The internal organ being affected by the external object through the path-way the sense-organs, there arises a functioning thereof, having the aforesaid external thing for its object, and having as its principal concern the ascertainment of a certain specific aspect of the object, which naturally partakes of the generic as well as of the specific. Such a function constitutes the Right Notion, called Perception. The effect of this Right Notion is the cognition of the function of the internal organ--the cognition belonging to the Spirit, and being co-ordinate or identical (with the Buddhi). The Spirit is the joint-cogniser with the internal organ. This we explain later on. <p>Of the object of inference there is a certain relationship which is to all homogenous objects, and dissociated from the heterogeneous ones; the function, having this relation for its object, concerned chiefly with the ascertainment of the generic (character of things), is Inference. As for example-- The planets have motion, because they approach different regions, like Chaitra;--the Vindhya Mountain having no such approach, has no motion.<p>A certain object, having been either perceived or inferred by an authoritative person, is verbally expressed for the sake of transferring that cognition to another person. The function having, through words, such a thing for its object, is Testimony for the listener. That Testimony fails which is on the assertion of an untrustworthy speaker, who has neither seen nor inferred an object truly. If however, the original speaker has seen and inferred an object truly, then the testimony becomes infallible.",
"8. <b>Sutra:</b> Misconception is false notion, abiding in a form, which is that (of the object).<p>This is not right notion; because, it is always set aside by right notion, which has for its object something really existing in the external world. It has been always seen that a right notion always sets aside a wrong one; e.g. the perception of the double moon is set aside by the subsequentive of the single moon.<p>It is this that constitutes the five-fold Illusion or Nescience :- (1) Ignorance, (2) Egotism, (3) Attachment, (4) Envy, and (5) Tenacity of life--the five Troubles. These five have also the respective names of: (1) Tamas (Darkness), (2) Moha (Illusion) (3) Mohamoha (Great Illusion), (4) (Timisra) and (5) Andhatamisra (Blinding darkness). This will be defined in the impurities of the internal organ.",
"9. <b>Sutra:</b> Fancy is (a notion) founded on knowledge conveyed by words, but of which there is no object (corresponding in reality).<p>This cannot included either within Right Notion, or within Misconception. Because though it has got no object corresponding in reality, yet its acceptance in usage is seen to be based on the power of the knowledge of words. As for example, the assertion--Intelligence is the form of the Spirit. If the Spirit is nothing more than intelligence, then what would be named and qualified by what? It is only when there is such nomination or qualification that we have the function.--e.g. Chaitra's cow. Similarly--The Spirit, having all objective properties alienated from it, is devoid of action; and--Bana sits, will sit, and sat. With regard to absence of motion, however, only the meaning of the root is signified. Similarly again, Spirit has the property of non-production, --qualifying adjunct here implying merely the negation of production, and not any property belonging to the Spirit: and for this reason, (in the example given) the qualification is a fancied one, on the said usage is based.",
"10. <b>Sutra:</b> Sleep is the function having for its object the conception of negation.<p>And this is a particular kind of conception, because it is recalled in the waking state. How? In this manner: (l) have slept well; my happy mind brightens my intellect. (2) I have slept ill; my mind wandering listlessly, has become worthless. (3) I have slept like of log of wood; my limbs are heavy; and my tired mind is lazy and seems to be absent. This recalling by a person on waking would not have been, if there were no knowledge of any conception; the reminiscences connected with sleep could not have the conception for their object. Therefore Sleep is a particular conception; and this too, like all other conceptions, ought to be suppressed during meditation.",
"11. <b>Sutra:</b> Memory is the non-relinquishment of an object that has been cognised.<p>Does the internal organ remember the cognition, or the object? The cognition,--coloured by the cognised (object), and (as such) manifesting (or illuminating) the forms of both the cognised (object) and the cognition,-- produces an impression, (samskara) of the same character. And this impression, being of the same form as its cause, brings about a recollection of the same character, partaking of both the cognised and the cognition.<p>Of these, the cognition has got the form of the cognition for its principal factor; and Memory or Recollection has got the form of the cognised for its precedent.<p>This Memory is two-fold -- (1) One whose object to be remembered is assumed, and (2) the other whose object is not assumed. During a dream we have the former, whereas in the waking state, we have the latter.<p>All kinds of Memory owe their existence to the prior experience of Right Notion, Misconception, Fancy, Sleep and Memory.<p>All these functions are constituted by pleasure, pain and illusion. These three will be explained under Klesa. Attachment belongs to pleasure and envy to pain; while illusion is ignorance. All these functions are to be suppressed --their suppression leading to one of the two sorts of Meditation.",
"12. What is the means for the suppression of these?<p><b>Sutra:</b> By Exercise and Dispassion, (follows) their suppression.<p>The river of the internal flows both ways. It flows for good, and it flows for evil. That which has its mouth at Isolation, and its bottom in Discrimination, flows for good. Where-as the one having its mouth at Rebirth and its bottom in Non-discrimination, flows for evil. Among these, the flow of (worldly) objects is thinned by Dispassion; and the flow of discrimination is opened by the Exercise of discriminative vision. Thus we see that the suppression of the functions of the internal organ is dependent upon both of these.<p>",
"13. <b>Sutra:</b> Exercise is the effort towards quietness.<p>Quietness (Sthiti) is the calm flow of the internal organ clear of its functionings. And Exercise consists in an effort for this i.e. an undaunted courageous and spirited endeavour, consisting in acting upto the means of attaining the aforesaid calmness.",
"14. <b>Sutra:</b> But it is of firm ground when attended to for a long time unremittingly and with proper devotion.<p>Being attended to for a long time, and unremittingly --and brought about by penance, celibacy, knowledge and faith, and as such endowed with proper devotion-it becomes steadfast; that is to say, its object is not then easily suppressed by the impressions of the agitative stage.",
"15. <b>Sutra:</b> Dispassion is the (Vashikarasanjna) Consciousness of being the subjugator, belonging to one who is devoid of any thirst for perceptible and scriptural objects.<p>One becomes devoid of any desire for the temporal perceptible objects--women, drink and wealth,--and for the scriptural objects, attainment of heaven, disembodiment, dissolution in Nature,--then his internal organ, noticing the objective discrepancies even in the relation of celestial and terrestrial objects, attains to the name of Vashikarasanjna which, on the strength of the recognition of discrepancies, is of the nature of anaabhoga, i.e., free from faults of attachment. (And this Vashikarasanjna or consciousness of being the subjugator, is Dispassion.)",
"16. <b>Sutra:</b> Indifference to the attributes, being conducive to the knowledge of the Spirit, is the highest ( form of it).<p>(1) The agent who recognises discrepancies in temporal and spiritual objects, and hence becomes dispassionate, and (2) one whose internal organ has been calmed by supreme discrimination due to the purity of spiritual exercise, and who has hence detached from the attributes constituting the manifested and the unmanifested forms of matter;--these two indicate the two kinds of Dispassion. Of these, the latter is the sole effulgence of wisdom, on the appearance of which, the agent equipped with knowledge, reflects thus : I have attained to what I had to attain,-- the objects to be destroyed, the troubles, have been destroyed,--cut off is the thickly interwoven chain of metempsychosis, whose unbroken range causes the death of the born and the birth of the dead.<p>Dispassion is the highest stage of knowledge; and the necessary concomitant of this alone, is Isolation.",
"17. When the agent has suppressed his internal organ through the two means (just described), how can the meditation to said to be Conscious?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Conscious, because attended with the forms of argumentation, deliberation, joy, and egoism.<p>(1) Argumentation is the gross perception of the internal organ, with regard to its object; whereas (2) Deliberation is subtle in its nature. (3) Joy is delight. (4) Egoism is the partial cognition of identity.<p>Of these, the first followed by the other four constitutes the Argumentative Meditation ; the second, devoid of Argumentation, the Deliberative; the third without Deliberation the Joyful. The fourth without this, is purely Egoistic. All these forms of meditation are concrete.",
"18. Now, what is the nature of Unconscious or Abstract meditation and what are the means to it?<p><b>Sutra:</b> The other, preceded by the practice of the cause of suspension, is that in which the residua alone remain behind.<p>When all the functions have been suspended and the residua alone remain behind, then we have a suppression of the internal organ, which constitutes (a form of) meditation, called the Unconscious or Abstract.<p>Of this the means is the highest form of Dispassion (see above). And, because an exercise based on an object would not be capable or being fit for its accompaniment, therefore the objectless (or immaterial) cause of suspension is made the basis here: and this cause is devoid of any material object. (Consequently) the internal organ, preceded by the practice thereof, becomes immaterial, as if non-existing. This Immaterial or seedless meditation is what is called the Unconscious or the Abstract.",
"19. This ( meditation ) is of two kinds-- The Bhavapratyaya (caused by the world) and the Upaayapratyaya (caused by the means). Of these the latter belongs to the Yogis.<p><b>Sutra:</b> The world-caused belongs to the Disembodied and to the Resolved-into-Nature.<p>To the Disembodied--i.e. the celestial beings-- belongs the World-caused (Bhavapratyaya). These (beings),-- experiencing isolation as it were, by means of their internal organs aided by their residua alone,--carry over the residual fructifications which are cognate therewith. Similarly the Resolved-into-Nature experience isolation as it were, on the dissolution into Nature of the internal organ in its full activity; (and this experience continues only) so long as the internal organ, by its inherent authority does not return (to its work).",
"20. <b>Sutra:</b> Of others, preceded by faith, energy, memory, meditation and discrimination.<p>To the yogis belongs the Means-caused (Upaayapratyaya). Faith, confidence of the mind like the loving mother, sustains the Yogi. Energy accrues to an agent endued with faith and desirous of discrimination; and on the energetic attends Memory; on this the mind rests peacefully in contemplation; and to one of calm mind comes Discrimination, by means of which he comes to recognise things in their true colours, By constant practice of this, and by means of Dispassion with regard thereto, is brought about Unconscious or Abstract Meditation.<p>The nine yogis are such as have their means mild, moderate and excessive. E.g. (1) One of mild means, (2) Of moderate means, and (3) Of excessive means; of these again the first is of three kinds: (l) The mildly-dispassionate, (2) the moderately-dispassionate and (3) the ardently-dispassionate. There are similar divisions of the moderate means and the excessive means.",
"21. From among these, for those of excessive means (is laid down) ...<p><b>Sutra:</b> ... the ardently dispassionate, proximate<p>... is the accomplishment of meditation, as well as its end. ",
"22. <b>Sutra:</b> A further distinction, on account of the mild, the moderate and the excessive.<p>There is a distinction farther than this, such as: (1) The mildly-ardent, (2) the moderately-ardent, and (3) the excessively-ardent. On account of this distinction, the accomplishment of meditation and its ends, is near to one of excessive means when mildly-ardently-dispassionate, nearer to him when moderately-ardently-dispassionate, and nearest to him when excessively-ardently-dispassionate.",
"23. Is the extreme proximity of meditation due to this (above mentioned) cause alone? or is there any Other means to its attainment?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Or by devotion to God.<p>The Supreme God, being attracted by the devotion (of the yogi) favours him by mere prescience. And from this prescience also accrues to the agent, the accomplishment of meditation and its ends.",
"24. Who is this God, distinct from Nature and Spirit?<p><b>Sutra:</b> God is a distinct spirit, untouched by afflictions, actions, deserts and impressions.<p>Afflictions,--Ignorance and the rest. Actions, good and evil,--the effects of these are the Deserts,--and desires in accordance with these, are the Impressions; though these reside in the internal organ, yet they are attributed to the Spirit, who is the experiencer of their results; just as defeat or victory really belonging to the soldiers, is attributed to their leader. That Spirit, who is untouched by such experience, is God.<p>Though there are many master-adepts who have attained to such Isolation,--(yet) such have attained to Isolation after having cut off the three bondages; whereas the connection of God with these has neither been nor ever will be. We do not know of preceding bondage of God, as we do of the emancipated; nor is any future bondage possible for God, as it is for the Resolved-in-nature. He is ever Isolated and ever Supreme.<p>This eternal Supremacy of God, due to supreme goodness,--has it any proof, or it is incapable of proof?<p>Its proof lies in the Scripture.<p>What is the proof for this Scripture?<p>It lies in its supreme goodness. The connection between these two,--Scripture and its supreme character, resident as they are in God's Buddhi,--is eternal. From Scripture, it comes to this: that God is ever the Lord and ever emancipated.<p>And this supremacy of His is free from quality or excess, because it is never exceeded by any other supremacy; whatever should exceed it, would become that itself. Hence wherever there is the final stage of supremacy, that is God.<p>Nor is there any supremacy equal to it. Because when there are two things equally supreme (contending) with regard to a desired object, (one saying) may this be new and (the other contending) may this be old--then (in such a case) only one can be fulfilled, and as such there would result the resistance of the will of another, which would imply the lesser character of his supremacy. And further, to two equal persons cannot belong the simultaneous accomplishment of the desired object,--the objects being contradictory. Therefore He whose supremacy is free from equality and excess, is God; and He is a distinct Spirit.<p>",
"25. And further,...<p><b>Sutra:</b> In Him is the highest limit of the seed of omniscience.<p>The seed of omniscience is the cognition of the parvitude (or smallness) and magnitude (or largeness) of the perception of supersensorious objects, past, present and future, individually as well as collectively. And that person is omniscient in who this seed has grown to its utmost extent. There is a gradual progress of the seed of omniscience because it has various degrees, like Dimension (parimaana). That person in whom wisdom attains its limit, is omniscient; and this is a particular Spirit.<p>The above inference, ending in only a general conclusion, is nor capable of denoting any particular being; consequently the knowledge of particular names is to be looked for in the Scripture.<p>For God, though there is no selfish motive, yet there is the motive of mercy for the creatures,-- (being of the form) 'By mans or instructions in wisdom and virtue, I shall rescue all transmigratory spirits, at the periodical and the final dissolution'. As is declared: 'The first Knower, Lord and Great Sage (Kapila), with a view to creation, in his mercy, taught the Science to the enquiring Asuri.'",
"26. And such a one is --<p><b>Sutra:</b> the Greatest of even the earliest ones, because unconditioned by time.<p>The early great ones are all conditioned by time for whom time does not appear as a condition, is the instructor and hence the greatest of even the earlier ones; and as (the existence of such a one) is established, in this cycle, by superiority, so should it be understood with reference to the past cycles also.",
"27. <b>Sutra:</b> His indicator is the Pranava.<p>God is the indicated of the Pranava.<p>Is denotation of it convention, or is it inherent in it, like the light or the lamp? <p>The relation of this indicated (the God) with the indicator (the pranava) is inherent. Convention due to God only represents objects, already existing; as for example, the natural relation of the father and son is expressed by convention as 'This is the Father, and that his son.' In other cycles also, convention is dependent upon the (inherent) faculties of the indicator and the indicated. The masters of scripture declare the relation of word and meaning to be eternal because of the eternal character of universal agreement (in convention).",
"28. <b>Sutra:</b> Its repetition, and the contemplation of its meaning.<p>The repetition of the Pranava and the contemplation of its denotation--God. In its manner then the internal organ of the yogi, who repeats the pranava and reflects on its meaning, becomes concentrated; as is declared: 'After repetition, one should have recourse to meditation ; and after meditation, again he should take to repetition. Through perfection in repetition and meditation the supreme spirit lightens.' (Vishnu Purana)",
"29. What more accrues to him?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Hence the cognition of reversed perception and absence of obstacles. <p>All the obstacles--disease and the rest-- cease to exist, by virtue of devotion to God. And to him belongs the perception of his real character. 'As God is a Spirit, pure, blissful, isolated and free from troubles,--so also is this spirit, the counter-cogniser of Buddhi (intellect'--such being the recognition.",
"30. <b>Sutra:</b> Disease, Languor, Doubt, Carelessness, Sloth, Worldly-mindedness, Mistaken Notions, Missing the Point, and Instability;--these causing the distraction of the internal organ are the obstacles.<p>The obstacles, the distractors of the internal organ are nine. These are possible only in the company of the functions of the internal organ, which latter too are not possible without these. Disease--disorder of the humours, fluids and the senses. Languor--incapability of the internal organ to work. Doubt--cognition touching both ends of a subject--'this may be, this may not be'. Carelessness-- non-reflection on the means of meditation. Sloth-- Inactivity of the body and mind, due to lethargy. Worldly-mindedness-- desire with regard to the connection of the internal organ with sensorious objects. Mistaken Notions-- contrary or false cognition. Missing the Point--non-acquirement of the state of meditation. Instability--the unfixed character of the internal organ with regard to the stages already acquired. The mind would become steady for the accomplishment of meditation.<p>These the distractors of the internal organ, the mind impurities of meditation, also called the Enemies and obstacles of meditation.",
"31. <b>Sutra:</b> Pain, Irritation, Trembling, Inspiration and Expiration are the companions of distractions.<p>Pain--the natural, the terrestrial and the celestial Pain is that, being struck by which living beings try for its extirpation. Irritation--agitation of the mind, due to non-fulfillment of desire. Trembling--that which shakes the body. Inspiration--in that breath which touches (draws) the external air; and Expiration is which expels the internal air.<p>These are the companions of distractions. These happen to those whose minds are distracted; and not to those whose minds are at peace.",
"32. <b>Sutra:</b> For their prevention, exercise on one principle.<p>One ought to apply the internal organ fixed upon one single principle, for the prevention of distraction. One whose internal organ consists in mere cognition based upon several objects, and transitory, such a one's internal organ can never concentrated, and as such must be distracted. If however it is drawn away from other objects, and fixed on any one object, then it concentrated, and hence not based on several objects.<p>One who thinks the internal organ to be concentrated when it is found to consist in an uninterrupted flow of similar cognitions,-- for him, if concentration is a property of the current of the internal organ, then (there is the objection that) such a current cannot be one, because it is momentary. If however the concentration be said to belong to the cognition, only so far as the current is concerned,--then (there is the objection that in that case, the whole of this (current), consisting either in the current of similar cognitions, or of dissimilar ones, would be fixed upon several objects, and as such concentrated; and as such there could never be any distraction of the internal organ. Therefore it must be concluded that the internal organ is one, and has many objects. Again if by the one internal organ were brought about unconnected and heterogeneous (or dissimilar) cognitions then, one cognition would remember the object perceived by another cognition, and one would experience the effects of the karmic residua gathered by another cognition. Such a cognition, even if in any way fixed, would imply the rule of 'the cow dung and the milk- pudding.' (editor: i.e., the vulgar reasoning that the cow dung is the pudding, because both owe their existence to the cow).<p>And further, if the internal organ were different, then the (Banddha would fall into the danger of) having done away with the cognition of his self. How? 'I am touching what I had seen,' 'I am seeing what I had touched'--such a cognition is present to the agent as being identical, though the cognitions themselves are different. How would this consciousness of a single cognition, the cognition of the identical self,--existing in several and altogether dissimilar internal organs--rest itself upon a single conscious agent? This consciousness of personal identity is quite perceptible to the agent; and certainly the force of perception is not affected by any other proof; for all other proofs owe their strength in usage to perception alone.<p>Therefore the internal organ is one, fixed upon various objects and is steady.",
"33. Question. For some, this system lays down the purifier. Whence is this?<p><b>Sutra:</b> The peacefulness of the internal organ through friendliness, compassion, complacency and indifference in regard to pleasure and pain, and virtue and vice.<p>One ought to bear friendship towards all the beings that may be enjoying pleasure; compassion towards the distressed; complacency towards the virtuous ; end indifference towards the vicious. To one who thus bears himself, accrues pure virtue; thence the internal organ becomes cheerful (peaceful); and being cheerful, it becomes concentrated and attains to steadiness.",
"34. <b>Sutra:</b> Or by the expulsion and retention of breath.<p>The throwing out of the internal air through the nostrils, by a special effort, is Expulsion; Retention is the regulation of breath. By these two means also is one to bring steadiness of the internal organ.",
"35. <b>Sutra:</b> Or Cognition resulting from sensuous objects may be the cause of steadiness.<p>Of one who concentrates (his mind) on the tip of the nose, the consciousness of superphysical odour is the disposition of smell; by concentration on the tip of the tongue, the consciousness of taste; that of colour, in the palate; that of touch, in the centre of tongue; and that of sound at the base of the tongue. These dispositions, when produced, bind the internal organ to steadiness, remove all doubt, and become the means of meditative wisdom. A similar objective cognition is to be understood with regard to the cognitions of the sun, the moon, the planets, the gems and the like.<p>Though all principles, got at through the various sciences, inferences and the instructions of teachers, are always true,-- because all these agents have the capacity of expounding only true principles,--yet, so long as even a single portion thereof has not been amenable to one's own sense-organs, the whole of it appears far removed, and as such does not bring about the steadiness of the internal organ with regard to such subtle entities, as Isolation and the like. Therefore for the sake of strengthening the scientific, inferential and tutorial doctrines, one should always try to directly perceive any one of the particulars. And when a particular portion of the imparted doctrine has been directly perceived, then the agent gains faith in even the subtlest elements thereof, ending in Isolation. For this reason is this (objective cognition) called the perfection or embellishment of the internal organ.<p>With regard to the non-fixed (i.e. stray) cognitions, when there has been produced the Consciousness of having subdued (Vashikarasanjna) with regard thereto, then would it (the internal organ) be capable of directly perceiving the various objects. And on this will follow unimpeded, faith, energy, memory and meditation.",
"36. <b>Sutra:</b> Or the sorrowless, luminous.<p>Add 'disposition when produced causes the steadiness of the internal organ'--this much has to be continued (from the last aphorism). The perception (or consciousness) of the internal organ belonging to one who fixes on the lotus of the heart, is of two kinds: (l) The sorrowless, the objective, and (2) the pure egotism or self-consciousness which latter disposition is also called the luminous; whereby the internal organ of the yogi attains to steadiness. The internal organ in its goodness is effulgent and like the sky; and the disposition due to the purity of steadiness therein, develops into the form of the brightness of the sun, the moon, the planets and the precious gems. Similarly, the internal organ, fallen upon egotism or self-consciousness, becomes similar to the still waters of the ocean, calm and in connection herewith is declared. '(The agent), having thought of the atomic self, has the notion of, I am.'",
"37. <b>Sutra:</b> Or the internal organ having for its object the passionless.<p>The internal organ of the yogi, coloured by its object, and the internal organ of persons devoid of attachment, attain to steadiness.",
"38. <b>Sutra:</b> Or that depending on knowledge resulting from dream or sleep.<p>The yogi's internal organ, depending on the knowledge in dreams, or that in sleep, and becoming of the same form as these, attains to steadiness.",
"39. <b>Sutra:</b> Or by meditating according to one's predilection.<p>One ought to meditate upon the object which is most to his liking. The internal organ, having acquired steadiness in that, will be able to attain to it elsewhere also.",
"40. <b>Sutra:</b> His mastery extends from the minutest atom to infinite magnitude.<p>By thinking (or applying the mind) on minute objects (the Yogi) acquires (with regard to objects) up to the minutest atom; and by thinking on the gross objects he attains to the steadiness of the internal organ, extending to the utmost limit of infinity. Thus then (to the Yogi) who runs over both these ends, belongs non-bafflement (or non-disturbance); and this is supreme Mastery. The internal organ of the Yogi, having become accomplished through this mastery, no longer stands in need of the purifications brought about by practice (or exercise).",
"41. <b>Sutra:</b> To him of over-powered functions, like that of a clear gem, there is,--with regard to the cogniser, the means of cognition, and the cognised-- the modification, consciousness or state of similarity, identity, or consubstantiation with these, of that which rests in them.<p>'To him of overpowered functions'--To one whose cogitations have been suppressed. 'Like that of a clear gem' only cites an example. As a rock-crystal, affected by the forms of the several objects (presented to it), appears similar to them; so the internal organ, being affected by its object, the cognised, and thereby assuming its character, appears in the same form. That which is affected by minute elements, assumes their character, and as such appears in the same form; similarly that which is affected by a gross object, assumes its character and hence appears in a gross form; and lastly, in the same manner, that which is affected by the various modifications of the universe, assumes the character of such modifications, and as such in the same form. In the same manner, we should find with regard to the 'Means of cognition,' i.e. the sense-organs. (The internal organ) affected by the sense-organs, assumes their character and as such appears in the form. Similarly, when it is affected by the cognising agent as its object, it acquires his character as such appears form; and in the same manner becoming affected by the Free Spirit, it becomes identical therewith, and hence appears in that form.<p>Such is the character of the internal organ, similar to that or transparent jewels consisting in its identity, on cosubstantiation,--in matters relating to the cogniser, the means of cognition and the cognised, i.e. to the spirit, the sense-organs the elements,--with these (cogniser etc.), of that which rests in them (in this case the internal organ itself). And this is called Samapaati (condition, modification or consciousness).",
"42. <b>Sutra:</b> The argumentative condition is that which is mixed with the modification of words, meanings and understanding (or idea.)<p>As for example, we find and that with regard to the three aspects--'cow' the word, 'cow' the meaning or object, and 'cow' the knowledge or idea--we have an undifferentiated joint perception, though the three are really distinct from one another. Where however, they are differentiated, there are some properties of the word, of the meaning, and others again of the idea--Such is the way of their differentiation. If the object 'cow', rising to the contemplative consciousness of the yogi engaged in the aforesaid (fanciful perception), happens to be affected by the modification of word, meaning and idea, then it becomes of a mixed up condition, and is called the 'argumentative.'",
"43. When on the other hand, in the contemplative consciousness, which is free from all notions of verbal convention as well as from all modification of knowledge due to valid testimony and inference,-- then there appears the object in its own real form, characterised by nothing but this form alone; and that condition is the Non-argumentative. This is the highest perception; and it is the root of valid testimony and inference, both of these arising from it. Such a perception cannot be said to occur in the company of knowledge due to assertion and inference. Therefore the perception of the yogi due to non-argumentative Meditation, is unmixed with any other kind of right notion: and the author explains the definition of this non-argumentative condition, by means of the following aphorism:<p><b>Sutra:</b> The non-argumentative is that in which, on the dissolution of memory, the meaning (or object,) alone, is apparent, and which appears as if devoid of own identity.<p>All verbal convention, fancy with regard to knowledge due to testimony and inference, and memory, having been dissolved,--the consciousness, coloured by the form of the object of cognition (acceptance), forsakes, as it were, that form of its own which is constituted by the acceptance or cognition, and becomes solely of the form of the object-- i.e. assumes the form of the object of (acceptance or) cognition; and this (consciousness) is the non-argumentative condition. Thus has this been explained already (in the prefatory remarks to this aphorism).<p>The object of this condition is the universe of objects, animate or inanimate, which consists (respectively) in the object as a whole (in the case of animate objects) or in a particular agglomeration of minute particles (in the case of inanimate objects), and which gives rise to a unitary consciousness (i.e. the consciousness of the object as a single whole). This particular agglomeration (the gross object,) is the common property of the minute particles (constituting it); and as such constituting their very nature, it is inferred from the manifested effect (the notion of the object as a whole), and presents itself, through agencies leading to its manifestation; and disappears on the appearance of other properties (of the same particles). This same property (described above) is called the component (whole), which is 'one, large, small, tangible, active, and transient'; it is by means of such component wholes that all business is carried on. One to whom such a particular agglomeration is nothing (and the object of abstract perception), and to whom a minute (or subtle) cause is imperceptible (even to abstract indeterminate perception), --to such a one, there being no component whole, all knowledge would be false--false knowledge having been defined as 'notion abiding in a form which is not that of the object' (aph. 7). And under the circumstances there being no object, what could be his true knowledge? Whatever object is perceived has been decided to be a component whole. Therefore it must be admitted that there is a component whole, bearing the usage of largeness etc., which becomes the object of the non-argumentative condition.",
"44. <b>Sutra:</b> By this, the deliberative and the non-deliberative, as pertaining to subtile objects, are also described.<p>Of these that condition is called the 'deliberative' which pertains to the subtile Elements, whose properties have been manifested, and which are characterised by a notion of their place, time and cause. Of this also that which appears as the object of Meditative consciousness is such a subtile element as is qualified by an apparent property, and amenable to Unitary consciousness (see above). On the other hand, the non-deliberative condition is that which appertains in all ways and by all means to such subtile objects as are free from the specialisation of all properties past, present, and future, and yet accompanied by all properties, and containing them. Being of such character, the subtile Element by means of this same form becomes an object (of perception), and as such colours (or affects) the form of meditative consciousness. When this consciousness loses its own identity (form) and consists solely in the object, it is called the 'non-deliberative.' Of these the argumentative and the non-argumentative appertain to gross (extended) objects, whereas the deliberative and the non-deliberative appertain to the subtile ones. Thus also by this very non-argumentative (condition) has been described the destruction of fancy with regard to both.",
"45. <b>Sutra:</b> The Subtile objectivity terminates in the indissoluble.<p>Of the Earth--atom the odoriferous Element is the subtile object; of the, Aqueous, the taste-Element; of the Fiery, the colour-Element; of the Aerial, the tactile Element; of Space (akasha), the sound-Element; of these (the rudimentary Elements), again, self-consciousness is the subtile object; of self-consciousness, the dissoluble (Buddhi); of this Buddhi too the subtile object is the Indissoluble (Nature). And there is no subtile entity beyond the Indissoluble. If it be urged that--'The Spirit is such a subtile entity,'-- we reply--true; the subtility of the Spirit (with regard to Nature) is not of the character as that of Nature over Buddhi. 'What is it then?' Spirit is not the material cause of the dissoluble, though it is an instrumental cause. Therefore the subtilest of the subtile terminates in Nature.",
"46. <b>Sutra:</b> These verily constitute 'seeded' meditation.<p>These four conditions have external objects for their seed; consequently the meditation is seeded. Among these, that with regard to gross objects, is argumentative and non-argumentative, and that with regard to subtile objects, is deliberative and non-deliberative,--this four-fold has meditation been numbered.",
"47. <b>Sutra:</b> On the purity of the non-deliberative, internal perspicuity.<p>Purity consists in the steady current--untainted by Tamas and Rajas and hence clear of the principle or spiritual consciousness, consisting in brightness (or illumination) and free from the touch of all masking impurities. When this purity accrues to non-deliberative meditation, then to the yogi belongs internal perspicuity,--i.e. a clear conscious vision, irrespective of all sequence, with regard to real objects; as is declared: 'The wise reaching to the perspicuity of consciousness, look upon all beings, as a man on a mountain top does upon those on the ground below,--thinking of (other) beings, while being himself unthinkable.'",
"48. <b>Sutra:</b> Therein consciousness is truth-bearing.<p>During the aforesaid condition, the consciousness of the meditative one, has the name of truth-bearing; and this name is applicable literally; because such consciousness supports truth alone, there being not a trace of untruth; as is declared: 'By valid testimony, by inference, and by a respectful exercise of contemplation, bringing about his consciousness, one attains to supreme union (yoga).'",
"49. And this again...<p><b>Sutra:</b> ...has its subject different from those of revealed and inferential consciousness, because it refers to particulars.<p>'Revealed'--the knowledge due to the scriptures; this refers to generals; for certainly the scripture can never denote particulars. Why? Because, the word (on which revelation is based) has not its usage based on particulars. Similarly inference also refers to generals alone? (The typical form of inference being)--where approach is, there is access, and where there is non-approach, there is no access. Inference leads to conclusions only by generalities. Therefore there can be no particularity which can be the object of either revelation or inference. Nor is this subtile, veiled (occult) and magnificent object (of meditation) amenable to ordinary perception. Nor, lastly, can we deny the existence of such a particular, as unproved. Therefore this particular object--whether pertaining to the subtile Elements or to Spirit--is amenable to meditative consciousness alone. Therefore the aforesaid consciousness has an object different from those of revealed and inferential consciousness, because it appertains to particulars.",
"50. <b>Sutra:</b> The impression or residuum due to this is contradictory to other impressions.<p>The impression (residuum) arising from meditative consciousness obstructs the residuum of impression produced by the worldly condition (Vyutthana). And the impressions of the worldly condition having been suppressed, the cognitions due to these are no longer produced; and these cognitions being suppressed, meditation comes forward; then follows meditative consciousness, and in its wake, the impressions produced by that consciousness. Thus every time a new residuum of impressions is produced giving rise to a fresh supply of consciousness, which again in its turn would bring about fresh impressions. (Question): 'Wherefore will this excess of impressions not afford power i.e., function, or capacity to the internal organ'? (Reply): The impressions brought about by the aforesaid consciousness do not give power to internal organ; because they are the means of the removal of pain; in fact they serve to separate the internal organ from its functionings; for the functionings of the internal organ has its termination discriminative in wisdom.",
"51. What occurs to this?<p><b>Sutra:</b> On the suppression of this also, all being suppressed, (there is) meditation without seed.<p>And this is an obstacle not only to meditative consciousness, but also to all impressions produced by this consciousness. Why? Because the impressions produced by suppression always obstruct those produced by meditation. And the existence of impressions, produced by the suppressive mind, is to be inferred from the experience of the sequence of time with regard to the suppressed state of the internal organ. The internal organ resolves itself into its own permanent Prakriti (nature,) along with all the impressions, produced by the waking, the suppressed and the meditative conditions, partaking of isolation. Therefore such impressions are obstacles to the activity of the internal organ, and as such do not lead to its continuance. And thereby the internal organ, divested of its functions, desists along with the impressions of the isolated state;--and on the suppression of this, the Spirit abides in its own form, and hence is called pure and liberated."

"1. The Yoga belonging to one of pacified mind, has been expounded. Now begins the (consideration of the question): How would one whose mind is in the waking (worldly) state, achieve Yoga?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Ascetism, Study, and Resignation to God constitute an Active Yoga.<p>Yoga is not achieved by the non-ascetic. Asceticism is a means (to Yoga), because without asceticism it is impossible to distend the (bonds of) impurities, entangled in the meshes of sensuous objects, and intermixed with endless actions, afflictions, and desires. And the asceticism (here meant) is the undisturbed or unchecked peace of mind which is to be striven after by the yogi--such has been declared in the scriptures. Study--the repetition of the sacred words, the Pranava and the rest, or the study of the science treating of Liberation. Resignation to God--the offering of all actions to the Supreme Teacher or venerable (God), or the relinquishment to their fruits.",
"2. And this Active Yoga...<p><b>Sutra:</b> Is for the contemplation of Samadhi and for the attenuation of distractions.<p>Active Yoga, being striven after, leads to the cognition of Samadhi, and attenuates the distractions; and the distractions, being thus attenuated, are bound to have their roots burnt up as it were by the fire of wisdom, and thus to be deprived of their productive capacity. They having been attenuated, the discriminative knowledge of the difference between the material attributes and the Spirit, being untainted by distractions, and thus constituting the subtle consciousness;--has its functions finished, and is fit for the dissolution (literally, retrograde progress).",
"3. Now what are the distractions, and how many are they?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Ignorance, Egoism, Desire, Aversion, and Attachment are the five distractions.<p>Distractions-- that is to say the five misconceptions (1.8). These issuing forth strengthen the power (capacity) of the attributes, establish the various modifications, lay open the current of cause and effect, and lastly, depending upon mutual aid, bring out the fructification of Karma.",
"4. <b>Sutra:</b> Ignorance is the breeding ground for those that follow-- (whether they be) dormant, weak, intercepted, or operative.<p>Here Ignorance is the breeding ground i.e., the productive ground of the following:--i.e., Egoism and the rest which are assumed to of four kinds--dormant, weak, intercepted, and operative.<p>Of these, what is dormancy? It is the germinal condition of the distractions abiding in the mind only by their latent potency (i.e., not yet existing in reality). The awakening of these consists in their proximity to their respective objects. For one, however, who has wisdom, and the seed of whose distractions has been burnt up,--this does not exist, even, on the presentation of the object. For, whence the sprouting of a burnt seed? For this reason, the expert, whose distractions are at an end, is called the Charamadeha (Lit. The Last-body). It is only in such a body, and nowhere else, that distractions attain the fifth condition-- wherein the seed has been burnt. In that condition the existing distractions have their productive faculty burnt up, and hence even on the proximity of the objects they have no awakening. Thus has been described dormancy as also the non-production of the burnt seeds.<p>Weakness is (now) described: Distractions become weak, by being put down by contrary practices. Similarly on being intercepted again and again, they appear again by means of their respective forms,--and are thus said to be intercepted. How ? Because anger is not seen simultaneously with attachment. For certainly anger does not operate at a time when there is attachment. And further, the fact of attachment existing with regard to one object does not lead to the inference of the absence of attachment with regard to (all) other objects. For the assertion that 'Chaitra is attached to one woman' does not lead to the conclusion that 'he has an aversion towards all other women'; all that is meant by the former assertion is that attachment is already in operation with regard to the particular woman, whereas with regard to other women it has only got a potency to become operative at some future time. And such a (distraction endued with a future potency) becomes either dormant or weak or intercepted. That which is already operating with regard to its object, is said to be operative.<p>All these do not go beyond the limits of distraction. Which distraction then, is intercepted, dormant, weak or operative? This will be explained later on. True--but they have been said to be intercepted etc. only with regard to their particular phases. As it is suppressed by contrary agencies, so it is rendered manifest by its manifesting causes.<p>All these distractions are forms of ignorance. Why? Because Ignorance pervades through all of them. The form that Ignorance gives to an object, by that form alone do the distractions abide; and they are found to exist simultaneously with misconception, as well as to disappear with Ignorance.",
"5. The form of Ignorance is now described:<p><b>Sutra:</b> Ignorance is the notion of the identity of the eternal, the pure, the joyous and the spirit, with that which is non-eternal, impure, painful and non-spirit.<p>The cognisance of eternality in non-eternal effects e.g. 'the permanent earth', 'permanent the heavens together with the moon and stars', Immortal the celestial beings'. Similarly there is cognition of purity in the impure and disgusting body: it being declared: 'on account of the position, the seed, the constituents and also on account of death, and lastly on account of purity being imposed upon it,--the learned have declared the body to be impure.' e.g. 'Beautiful like the fresh moon, this girl appears as if her limbs were made up of honey end ambrosia, or as if she had emerged from the moon; and she, having eyes like the blue lotus leaves, by means of her love-ful eyes, enlivens as it were, the living world':--(in this) what has any relation to what? (A. The whole is altogether an unconnected whole). Thus we find that there is a mistaken notion of purity with regard to impure things. Similar to this is the of virtue in vice, and that of useful in the useless.<p>In the same manner, the notion of pleasure in pain will be spoken of in aphorism 15 of section II. The idea of pleasure in the pain spoken of in the aphorism referred to is Ignorance.<p>Similarly, the idea of spirit in the non-spirit, such as in the external accessories, sentient as well as insentient,--or in the body which is the substratum of experience,--or in the mind, the accessory of the spirit. In this connection it is declared: 'Taking the manifested or unmanifested accessories to be his self, he rejoices in their prosperity, thinking such prosperity to be his own; and deplores their calamity, thinking it to be his own;-- such a one is altogether deluded.' (Panchashikhacharya).<p>Such is Ignorance, having four feet as it were, the root of all the series of troubles, as also of all karmic residua, together with their fructification. Like the words Amitra and Agoshpada, Ignorance (Avidya) is a positive entity. As the word Amitra does not denote the absence of a friend, nor a single friend, but it denotes something contradictory thereto,--an enemy;--and again as the word Agoshpada does not denote the absence of the foot-print of the cow, nor the single foot print of cow; on the other hand it denotes something quite other than these two, --a particular country; in the same manner Ignorance is neither right conception, nor the absence of right conception,-- it is quite an independent idea by itself, opposed to knowledge or wisdom.<p>",
"6. <b>Sutra:</b> Egoism is the identifying of the power that sees with the power of seeing.<p>Spirit being the 'power that sees' and the mind the 'power of seeing',-- the conception of the identity of these two constitutes the distinction of egoism. It is only on the non-discrimination of the two quite unblended and distinct powers of the enjoyer and enjoyed that enjoyment arises; when however, the true nature of the two has been ascertained, there follows isolation, and all enjoyment disappears. This has been thus declared: 'Not perceiving the spirit, which is above mind, and which is distinct from it by reason of its form, character, wisdom and the like,--one forms of the idea of self therein (in the mind) only through stupidity'-- (Panchashikhacharya)",
"7. <b>Sutra:</b> Desire is that which dwells on pleasure.<p>Desire is the hankering after pleasure or its means, preceded by a remembrance of the pleasure, belonging to one who has had experience of that pleasure.<p>",
"8. <b>Sutra:</b> Aversion is that which dwells on pain.<p>Aversion consists in the anger, desire for removal, of pain or its means, preceded by a remembrance of pain,-- belonging to one who has had experience of that pain.",
"9. <b>Sutra:</b> The well-known (distraction), that which flows in the current of its own residua, and which is well known to the learned even, is Attachment (or Tenacity of Life).<p>To all living beings there is the constant selfish wish-- 'May I not cease to be.' 'May I continue to exist.' And such a selfish desire does not belong to one who has not experienced the experience. This is the distraction called 'Attachment (to Life),' which flows in the current of its own residua. To the lowest worm just born there is a fear of death, consisting in consciousness of its (coming) annihilation, not borne out by either perception or inference, or valid testimony;--and such it testifies to the pangs of death experienced in previous births. As this distraction is found among the extremely stupid, so is it found to be known to the learned also; because the aforesaid residua, resulting from the experience of the pangs of death, is common to both the expert and the stupid.",
"10. <b>Sutra:</b> These, the subtile ones, should be suppressed by retrogression.<p>On the dissolution of the active mind of the Yogi, the aforesaid five distractions, having their seeds nearly burnt up, disappear together with it (the mind).",
"11. Of those that still continue, and have attained to the condition of the seed.--<p><b>Sutra:</b> Of these, the functions are to be suppressed by contemplation.<p>The gross functions of the distractions, having been attenuated by active yoga, are to be suppressed by contemplative wisdom, till they become Subtile, i.e. till they have their seeds nearly burnt up. Just as the dust in a piece of cloth is at first shaken off, and the finer kinds then removed by finer means,--so in the same manner, the gross functions of the distractions have small adversaries, whereas the subtile ones have great adversaries.",
"12. <b>Sutra:</b> The residua of actions have their origin in distractions, and are felt in the manifest or the unmanifest life.<p>Of these, the residua of virtuous and vicious deeds give birth to desire, avarice, stupidity and anger; and this residuum is felt either by the manifest birth or by the unmanifest one. Of these that which is brought about by ardent repetition or mantras or by asceticism or by meditation,--or that Which is accomplished by proper attendance on (or devotion to) the great ones--The Lord, the elemental Gods, the great Rishis,-- such a residuum of virtuous actions, bears immediate fruit. In the same manner, the repeated harms that are done to the fearing, the sick and the helpless, or to one who has confidence in the agent, or to the great ascetics --such a residuum of vicious actions also bears immediate fruit. As the Nandisvara Kumara, having relinquished the human modification, was transformed into a god, and so also Nahusha the Lord of the gods, having relinquished his own form, was transformed into a beast. Of hellish beings there is no Karmic residuum which is felt in the manifest birth; and for those whose distractions have ended, there is no Karmic residuum to be felt in the unmanifest (future) birth.",
"13. <b>Sutra:</b> The root existing, its fruition (consists in) birth, life (or age) and experience.<p>It is only when the distractions exist that the Karmic residuum begins its fruition and not when the root in the shape of distractions has been destroyed. As for example, the rice in the paddy, is capable of sprouting up only when it is surrounded by the chaff, and has its seeding faculty undestroyed; and not when the chaff has been removed and the seeding faculty destroyed. Similarly the Karmic residuum is fit to sprout up into fruition only when hemmed in by distractions, and not when the distractions have been removed, or when its seeding faculty has been destroyed by the fire of wisdom.<p>This fruition is threefold. Birth, Age and Experience. In this connection we have to consider the following questions. <p>Editor: p.56 was missing in my scanned copy of the 1907 edition, so I am using text from the revised (verbose) 1934 edition to fill in the translation for this missing portion.<p>(a) Is one act the cause of one birth? or (b) does one act bring about several births? and secondly, the question--(c) Do several acts bring about several births? or (d) do several acts bring about one birth?<p>(a) One act cannot be the cause of one birth;-- why?--because, if that were so, then, people would cease to have any confidence (in the fruitfulness of good deeds); as there can be no certainty regarding the order of the appearance of the results of the innumerable acts accumulated from beginning-less time--in the shape of the remnants of those whose results have already accrued to the Man,--as also those of the acts that he us doing in his present life; and such want of confidence would be highly undesirable.<p>(b)Nor can a single act be the cause of several births;--why?--because, in that case from among the past innumerable acts, if each one were to be the cause of several births, then we would be faced with the contingency that there would be no time for the fruition of the remaining acts; and this would also be an undesirable contingency.<p>(c) Nor again can several acts be the cause of several births;--why?-- because, as it is not possible for the several births to occur at one and the same time, it would be necessary to postulate that they occur one after the other, in some order of sequence; and this would be open to the same objection as stated before [in (a)].<p>From all this the conclusion is that what actually happens is as follows: Between one birth and death [during which the man is experiencing the effects of that portion of his Karmic residuum which has become operative, prarabdha, for that life], there remains (dormant) the entire store of the residua of the man's good and evil deeds (in the form of his Sanchita, stored up, Karma), which is of multifarious character, and wherein some (residua) are more important (potent) than others; and when the time of death arrives, all this store becomes manifested (i.e., more active) and the entire store, as one whole, brings about the man's death, and becoming operative (active) brings about his one birth (the one immediately following the said death). This Birth has its span of life also determined by the same set of acts, and the experience that the man undergoes during that life are also determined by that same set of acts. The Karmic Residua (which form part of the aforesaid store) being the cause of the man's Birth, Life, and Experience, is called 'three-fruited' [and this is called Prarabdha, that portion of the man's store of Karmic Residua which is operative during this one life; the rest of the store lying dormant, as explained above, during this life]. It is for this reason that the Karmic Residuum (the Prarabdha part of it) has been called Ekabhavika, 'operative during one Life'.<p>Editor: Resuming from 1907 edition.<p>On the other hand, that which is felt by the manifest birth, being the cause of experience alone, is said to originate a single fruition; or when it is the cause of life and experience both, it is said to originate a two-fold fruition as in the case of Nandisvara or Nahusa. The residual longings (Vasana) caused by the experience of the fruition of actions and distractions from time immemorial turn the mind into one aggregate whole; and the mind being this variegated appears like a fishing net spread over with knots (which in the case of the mind would be the various residua as above described); thus are these residua said to be preceded by (caused by) many births. It is the Karmic residuum alone that is said to be of one birth. The impressions or tendencies (sanskaras) which cause the memory (or remembrance), are the residual longings (Vasana), and are eternal.<p>The one-birth Karmic residuum is both of certain and uncertain fruition. Of these, this rule (the rule or being of one birth) holds only in the case of the residuum experienced in the manifest birth. whose fruition is certain, and not in that of the residuum experienced in the manifest birth whose fruition is uncertain. Because in the case of the latter there are three courses: (l) The destruction of that which has been done, but has not borne results, (2) inclusion (of the secondary ones) in the primary action, (3) the long continuity (of the secondary ones) hemmed in by the primary action whose function is certain. As an example of the first we have the destruction in the present life of the black (evil) actions by the white (good) ones. In this connection it is declared 'In this world actions are to be considered two-fold; the aggregate of good actions destroys the evil ones; therefore desire to perform good actions ; the wise ones declare actions for thee in this present (birth).' To exemplify the second: 'There may be little (of evil), mixed up (with the good), removable, and bearable; it is not capable of reducing the good ones;--why? Because the quantity of the good is much, wherein this (evil) is hidden, and which is sure to bring about a slight harm even in heaven'. (Panchashikhacharya). To exemplify the third course--'The long continuance of the secondary action hemmed in by the primary one whose fruition is certain'--How? Because it is only for the action experienced in the unmanifest birth, whose fruition is certain, that the cause of manifestation has already been said to be death, which is not the cue with that which is experienced in unmanifest birth, whose fruition is uncertain. This latter kind of actions may either be destroyed or dissolved (mixed up with the more important actions), or lastly long continue to exist as hemmed in (by those important actions),--so long as it is not turned towards fruition by its manifesting cause, in the form of some similar action. And it is for this uncertainty of the time, place and cause of the fruition of actions, that the course of action is said to be curious and unintelligible. As the secondary cannot be set aside by the primary, therefore we postulate the 'One-birth' karmic residua.",
"14. <b>Sutra:</b> They have pleasure or pain for their fruit, according as their cause is virtue or vice.<p>'They'--birth, age and experience, having virtue for their cause, have pleasure for their fruit; and when they have vice for their cause, then they have pain for their fruit. As this pain consists in contrariness (to the agent's wishes), so also in the course of pleasurable enjoyment of an object, there is pain for the yogi.",
"15. How do explain this? (Reply :)<p><b>Sutra:</b> To the wise, all is pain,-- because of the adverse functions of the Attributes, and of the pains of consequence, anxiety and impression.<p>(1) The experience of pleasure, belonging to all persons, is infused with passion, and dependent upon animated and inanimate means; thus in this case there is the Karmic residua born of passion; similarly the agent avoids the means to pain, and is deluded (or infatuated),--so there is the Karmic residuum born of aversion and stupefaction. As is declared: 'No enjoyment is without killing some beings',--thus there is the bodily Karmic residuum born of the slaughter, and it has already been declared that all sensual pleasure is Ignorance, pleasure consists in the peace resulting from the satisfaction of the senses with regard to sensuous objects, and pain consists in the want of peace resulting from fickleness. And certainly the satisfaction of the senses cannot be brought about by repeated enjoyment; why? Because the passions grow by repeated enjoyment, as does also the pertness of the senses. Consequently repeated enjoyment cannot be the means of pleasure. Thus then if a person desiring pleasure, is infused with (a desire for) sensuous objects and hence becomes entangled in the mire of pain,-- it affords a parallel to the case of one who, fearing the bite of the common scorpion, is stung by a serpent. This pain of consequence (i.e. the pain that follows as a result of pleasure), being contrary (to the wish), troubles the yogi even in state of pleasure, (because he knows that it will end in pain).<p>(2) Now, what is the nature of the pain of anxiety? All men have the experience of anxiety, infused With aversion, depending upon animate and inanimate causes--thus there is Karmic residuum born of aversion; and again with a view to the means of pleasure, the agent acts by body, words and mind, and thereby favours or harms another; and this favouring or harming of others brings about an aggregate of virtue and vice,--this Karmic residuum proceeds from avarice and delusion; and this is what is called the pain of anxiety.<p>What is the pain of impressions? The residuum of pleasurable impressions proceeds from an experience of pleasure and that of painful impressions from the experience of pain. Similarly, when either pleasure or pain is experienced, as fruits of actions, then again follows the stock of Karmic residuum. Thus this everlasting flow of the current of pain, consisting in contrariness (to his wishes), makes the yogi anxious; why? Because the wise is like the eye-ball; just as a fine thread of wool put in the eye gives pain by mere touch, which it does not do in other parts of the body, so do the aforesaid pains give pain to the eye-ball-like yogi alone, and to no other agent. On the other hand, the agent who relinquishes the pain caused by his own actions which he has borne, and again bears that which has been relinquished,-- and who is on all sides hemmed in by Ignorance as it were in the form of the mental function variegated by everlasting residual longings,--and lastly, who has the idea of self and mine With regard to the objects to be avoided (the body, wife and children etc.),--such an agent, whenever he is born, is flooded over by threefold pain, brought about both by extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Thus then, seeing his own self as well all other beings hemmed in by the everlasting current of pain, the yogi takes refuge in proper Discrimination, which has the power of destroying all pain.<p>For the further reason of 'the adverse character of the functions of the Attributes, all is pain to the wise.' The Attributes of the Buddhi consisting in enlightenment, action (or energy) and idleness, depending upon mutual help, give rise to the quiescent, passionate or delusive cognition, partaking of (the character of) the three Attributes. And the functioning of the Attributes being fickle, the mind is said to be quickly modifying. The forms as well as the functions, in their excess, are contradictory to one another; whereas those that are in their ordinary condition cooperate with those that are in excess. Thus, these Attributes, depending upon one another, bring about the ideas of pleasure, pain and delusion; therefore each of them has the character of all the three; their difference depending upon the predominance and subserviency (of one or the other of them). And thus all is pain to the wise.",
"16. The four-foldness of this Science is:<p><b>Sutra:</b> Avoidable is the pain not yet come.<p>The pain that has passed has already been spent up by Experience, and as such cannot come within the range of avoidability. The pain that is present is, during the moment of its existence, ready for experience, as such cannot at any other moment, be avoided. For reason it is that pain alone which is not yet come, that gives pain to the eye-ball-like yogi, and none else; and it is this pain that is to be warded off.<p>",
"17. The cause of that which is to be avoided is now laid down:<p><b>Sutra:</b> The conjunction of the Spectator and the Spectacle is the cause of that which is to be warded off.<p>The Spectator (the Spirit), the cogniser of Buddhi; The Spectacle, i.e., All the properties that exist in the goodness of Buddhi. Such a spectacle, resembling a magnet, and operating by mere proximity, through its visibility comes to be the Spirit's own--(the spirit being) the Lord, of the form of (pure) consciousness. The Sattvic Buddhi (consciousness) becomes the object of experience and action (of the Spirit); and acquiring its existence through another form, dependent upon another, though by itself it is independent, on account of its being for another's purpose. Of these two, the spectator and the spectacle, the connection brought about for a purpose, is the cause of that which is to be avoided i.e.--of pain. And it has been declared: 'By avoiding the cause in the shape of connection therewith (with Buddhi) this would be an absolute remedy for pain'-(Panchashikha). Why? Because we know the remedy for the cause of pain, the avoidable,--e.g. the soles of the feet being capable of being pierced, and the thorn being capable or piercing, the remedy hereof lies in not putting the foot on a thorn, or putting it on it, doing so with shoes. One who knows, these three facts, and has recourse to the remedy, does not experience the pain caused by the pricking of the thorn. Why? Because of the capability of recognizing the three-foldness. Similarly with regard to the case in question, the Attribute of goodness is the object of pain caused by that of foulness, the causer of pain--Why? Because the action of paining must fall on an object; and the action of paining (in the present instance) falls on the object of the attribute of Goodness; and not on the Cogniser (the Spirit) who is non-modifiable and devoid of action. Because the Spirit has objects presented to himself (by Buddhi), therefore when the attribute of goodness (the spiritual consciousness) is afflicted, the Spirit too, on account of His dependence on its form, becomes afflicted.",
"18. The form of the Spectacle is now described:<p><b>Sutra:</b> The spectacle is of the nature of illumination, activity and inertia; it consists of the elements and the sense-organs; it is for the purpose of experience and emancipation.<p>Goodness is of the nature of illumination; Foulness of the nature of activity, and Darkness of the nature inertia. Thus, these Attributes principally coloured by one another, having the properties of (and capable of) connection and separation, with their respective forms accomplished by mutual help,--and though mutually subservient yet, having their respective capabilities unmixed,--capable of wielding their capabilities with regard to homogeneous and heterogeneous effects--having their respective proximity (functions) manifested at the time of their respective predominance (activity or operation)-- and though gunas (subservient) yet, having their existence inferred as included in the primary,--having these faculties employed in the accomplishment of the spirit's ends-- helping by mere proximity, and thus resembling a piece of magnet,--and even in the absence of any predisposing causes (such as virtue and the rest), following in the wake of any one of themselves (the one that happens to be the predominating attribute with regard to the effect in question),-- come to be denoted by the name of Pradhana (Primordial Matter),; and this is also called the spectacle.<p>This Spectacle consists of the elements and the sense-organs; i.e., modifying in the form of the elements, i.e., the earth and the rest, in their gross as well as subtile forms; and similarly modifying into the form of the sense-organs--the ear and the rest, in their gross as well as subtile forms. This is not without a purpose; on the contrary it operates only with view to a distinct purpose; consequently, the spectacle is for the purpose of the experience and emancipation of the Spirit. Of these, experience consists in the ascertainment of the forms of the desirable and the undesirable, not differentiated; ' and emancipation is the ascertainment of the nature of the experience. Besides these two, there is no other perception. As is declared: 'Even on the existence of three Active Attributes, he (the unwise one) recognises the various natural dispositions (virtue etc.) as presented to the fourth, the inactive Spirit, similar as well as dissimilar (to the attributes), the witness of their operations; and as such does not think any other form of perception possible.'--(Panchashikha).<p>(Question:) How are these two, experience and emancipation, --brought about as they are by Buddhi, and als0 existing therein--referred to the Spirit? (Reply :) Just as victory or defeat, rally belonging to the fighting soldiers, are referred to their master; because he enjoys the fruits thereof; so also bondage and emancipation, really belonging to the Buddhi, are referred to the Spirit, because He is the enjoyer or the fruits of both. Bondage is the non-accomplishment of the soul's purpose, belonging to the Buddhi; and the accomplishment of the same purpose constitutes emancipation. By this (it is established that) perception, memory, inference or assumptions (Uha), (Apoha), right knowledge, attachment --all belonging to Buddhi, are assumed to exist in the Spirit; because he is the enjoyer of the fruits or these.",
"19. Now begins the consideration of the ascertainment of the different forms of the Attribute, which make up the Spectacle.--<p><b>Sutra:</b> The specific and the unspecific, the solely mergent, and the non-mergent--are the stages of the Attributes.<p>Of these, Akasa, Air, Fire, Water and Earth, the five elements are the specific (directly evolved effects) of the unspecific sound, touch, colour, taste and odour (respectively). Similarly the ear, the skin, the eye, the tongue and the nostril,--the sensational sense-organs,--as also speech, the hands, the feet, and the two excretory organs--the five organs of action,--and lastly the universal mind--(all these eleven) are the specific (effects) of the unspecific form of Self-consciousness. This sixteen-fold specific modification belongs to the Attributes. The unspecific are six: viz: the rudimentary sound, the rudimentary touch, the rudimentary colour, the rudimentary taste, and the rudimentary odour,--having respectively one, two, three, four and five characteristics are the five 'unspecific;' and the sixth is Self-consciousness, pure and simples. These are the unspecific modifications of Mahat (Buddhi or consciousness) itself, which is capacity (capability of fulfilling the soul's purpose) pure and simple--That which is above the unspecific --is the 'solely mergent' spiritual consciousness,--in this, taking their stand, the unspecific modifications reach their highly developed states; and also when dissolving, they take their stand, in the same simple capacity, on the spiritual consciousness, and finally resolve themselves into the unmanifested and non-mergent primordial Matter (Nature), which is beyond existence and non-existence, as also beyond the existing and the non-existing (effects.)<p>This (consciousness) is the 'solely mergent' modification of the Attributes; and the 'non-mergent' modification is that which is beyond capacity and incapacity. In the non-mergent condition, the soul's purpose is not the cause; because it is the beginning of the non-mergent condition the soul's purpose does not act as the propelling cause; therefore the soul's purpose is not the cause thereof. And because this is not brought about by the soul's purpose, therefore it is called eternal. In the beginning of the three particular states (the solely mergent, the unspecific and the specific) the propelling is by the soul's purpose which becomes their cause; whence these three are called 'non-eternal'. The Attributes on the other hand, partaking of the properties of all of these, neither dissolve, nor are produced. They however appear as if endued with the properties of birth and dissolution, through (their connection with) the different individuals, past, present and future, which have the property of connecting themselves with the Attributes; just as Devadatta is said to be becoming poor or deteriorating, because his cattle are dying; so it is only the death of the cattle, and not the destruction of his own form, that constitutes his poverty. This case is exactly similar (to that of the apparent birth and death of the Attributes.)<p>The solely mergent, in close proximity to the non-mergent, and originating therein, become divided therefrom,-- because of the infringibility of the order of sequence; for certainly the sequence is never broken; similarly the six unspecific modifications originating in the solely mergent become divided therefrom in accordance with the fixed order of sequence of the modifications. In the same manner, the elements and the sense-organs, originating in these unspecific ones, become divided therefrom. As has been declared above: 'There is nothing beyond the specific',--i.e., of the specific there is no further modification into any other object. Later on, we shall explain their modification into a condition characterised by virtue.",
"20. The spectacle has been described; now commences the determination of the form of the spectator.<p><b>Sutra:</b> The spectator is absolute sentience, and though pure, (still) beholds intellected ideas.<p>Absolute sentience i.e. the faculty of perception pure and simple, unalloyed with qualifications (illumination); this is the counter-cogniser of consciousness. He is neither similar nor dissimilar to it. He is not similar. Why? Because consciousness appertaining to known as well as unknown objects, is modifiable; its objects--cow, jar and the like,--being known and unknown, prove it to be modifying. The fact of the Spirit having every object always known to him implies his unmodifying character. Why? Because, (1) consciousness, which is also the object of the Spirit, cannot be both the perceiver and the non-perceiver. Thus is established the fact of every object being always known to the Spirit; which further proves his unmodifying nature. And further (secondly) consciousness is another's purpose, because of its operating conjointly (with the sense-organs, the sensuous objects and self-consciousness); the Spirit on the other hand, exists for his own purpose. And (thirdly) again consciousness, capable of ascertaining all the objects, (peaceful, passionate or dark), is made up of the three Attributes, and as such, is insentient; the Spirit on the other hand is the spectator of the three Attributes. For these reasons the Spirit is not similar to consciousness. Then let it be dissimilar. No; it is not altogether dissimilar either. Why? Because 'though pure, still it beholds intellected ideas--i.e., because it perceives the ideas belonging to consciousness; and thus perceiving appears similar to it, though really it is not so; as has been declared: 'The faculty of the experiencing agent, unmodifying and non-transferable, appears as if transferred to the modifying object, and falls in with the function there of; and (the same faculty),--endued only with an imitation of the Buddhic function which has been coloured by the touch of sentience,-- and as such really untainted by the Buddhic functions,--is called the function of knowledge'--Panchashikhacharya.", 
"21. <b>Sutra:</b> Only for his purpose is the being of the spectacle.<p>The spectacle becoming the object of the Spirit whose form is sentience pure and simple,--the being i.e., the form of the spectacle is for his purpose. On the accomplishment of experience and emancipation, the (insentient) form of the spectacle, attaining to its existence through another form (the sentient form of the spirit reflected therein), is no longer seen by the Spirit. The destruction of the form would lead to the destruction of the spectacle; but it is not destroyed.",
"22. Why?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Destroyed in the case of one whose purpose has been fulfilled, it is not destroyed, for she is common to others besides him.<p>Though the spectacle is destroyed with regard to the one Spirit whose purpose has been fulfilled, yet it is not destroyed, because it is common to other spirits. Though it is destroyed with regard to the expert soul, still not having its purpose fulfilled with regard to the inexpert one, it becomes the object of the sentience of these latter; and as such it still continues to acquire its existence through another's. Thus the faculties of the seer and the seen being eternal, their ever-lasting connection has been described. As has been declared: 'The objects possessing certain properties being eternal, the connection of the properties themselves too is eternal.'",
"23. The next aphorism has been called forth by a desire to lay down the form of the conjunction (just spoken of in aph. 17):-<p><b>Sutra:</b> Conjunction is the cause of the recognition of the natures of the faculties of itself and that of its Lord's.<p>The Spirit, the Lord, becomes conjoined with his spectacle, for the sake of perception. Hence, the apprehension of the spectacles through such a conjunction is experience; on the other hand the recognition of the nature of the spectator is emancipation. The conjunction having its end in perception, this latter is said to be the cause of disjunction; and non-perception being contradictory to perception, it is said to be the cause of conjunction. Here perception is not the cause of emancipation, because the absence of non-perception leads to the absence of bondage; and this is emancipation. And because the existence of perception leads to its negation, non-perception, the cause of bondage,-- therefore the cognition of perception is said to be the cause of Isolation.<p>Now, what is this 'non-perception'? (1) Is it a privileged office of the Attributes? or (2) is it the non-production of the principal mind which has presented objects to its sentient Lord i.e. the want of perception in his spectacle? or (3) is it the fact of the attributes resting in the purpose (experience and emancipation)? or (4) Ignorance with its mind being suppressed (i.e., becoming similar to its cause, Nature), is the productive seed (in the form Vasana) of its mind (and thus in this case non-perception being the residual longing of Ignorance)? or (5) on the destruction of the impression (Samskara) of fixity (sthiti), the manifestation of the impression of motion? In this connection it has been declared: 'The Pradhana, continuing in its fixity, and as such not producing any modifications, would become the non-Pradhana (i.e., the non-cause, the inefficient cause); similarly continuing in its mobility, its modifications would become eternal, and thus too would it become non-Pradhana (because the character of the Pradhana consists in producing modifications and thence affording experience for the spirit, and in time dissolving it, and bringing about his emancipation). It is only when it operates both ways (both by fixity and mobility), that it is called Pradhana, not otherwise. The same consideration holds respecting other causes. Or (6) the power of the spectacle (experience etc.) alone is non-perception--so say some; on the strength of the Sruti: 'The operation the Pradhana is for the information of the soul.' The spirit capable of apprehending all that is to cognised, does not perceive anything, prior to the operation of Nature; and then too the spectacle, which is capable of producing all effects, is not perceived; and this is non-perception. (7) Some people assert that non-perception is the property of both (the spectator spirit, and the spectacle). In this case the perception of the spectacle, though constituting its very nature, is yet recognised as the property of the spectacle only through the cognition the spirit (because without the reflection of the sentience of the spirit, no conscious perception is possible); similarly though the perception does not constitute the nature of the spirit, yet it appears to be the property of the spirit, through the cognition of the spectacle (because without the reflecting spectacle no perception is possible). (8) Lastly, some people assert non-perception to be the consciousness of the perception.<p>All these alternatives are mere fancies of the scientific mind. In this connection, the great number of alternatives has a common object in reference to the conjunction of all the souls with the attributes.",
"24. The conjunction of the retrograde sentience with its own spiritual consciousness (is such that) ...<p><b>Sutra:</b> its cause is Ignorance;<p>... that is the residual longings of misconceived ideas. Spiritual consciousness, coloured by the residual longings of misconceived notions, attains to the effectual condition of spiritual discrimination, and again returns (to its operations) with full-fledged powers. When however it ends in spiritual discrimination, then it attains its highest limit of effectiveness and having its office thus fulfilled it ceases to act; and hence devoid of perception, does not return to its operation, there being no cause of bondage.<p>A certain person (the Nihilist) jokes at emancipation through the example of an impotent husband:--'The impotent person being exhorted by his young wife in this manner-- My dear, my sister has children, wherefore have I not got any?--replies to her thus: when I am dead, then will I produce children for thee. In the same manner the knowledge when present not accomplishing the suppression of the mind, what hope is there of its accomplishing it when it itself will have been destroyed?' In reply to this a certain sect of the masters (of our Science): The suppression of the consciousness itself constitutes emancipation, the said suppression resulting from the absence of the cause of non-perception,--this non-perception, the cause of bondage, disappearing on (right) perception.'<p>Thus then it is the suppression of the mind that constitutes emancipation; and as such, wherefore this inopportune mental aberration (of the Nihilist.)<p><em>(The aphorism decides in favour of the fourth of the eight alternatives discussed with the last aphorism.)</em>",
"25. That which is to be warded off is pain, the cause of which has been declared to be Conjunction together with its causes. Now it remains to describe the process of avoidance.<p><b>Sutra:</b> From its absence, there is absence of conjunction, (which is) avoidance; and that is the Isolation of the spectator.<p>From the absence of non-perception, there is absence of the conjunction of the spirit and spiritual consciousness,-- that is to say, the absolute cessation of bondage. This is 'avoidance,' and 'it is the isolation or the spectator' --that is, the non-mixture of the spirit, the non-conjunction with the attributes. On the disappearance of the cause of pain, there is cessation of pain which is (its) avoidance; and after this, the spirit abides in his own form.",
"26. Now, what is the means of getting at this avoidance?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Undisturbed discriminative knowledge is the means of avoidance.<p>Discriminative knowledge is the recognition of the difference between the Spirit and the Attributes. And this knowledge becomes disturbed by the non-cessation of false knowledge. When however this false knowledge has its seeding faculty burnt up, and as such ceases to procreate, then flows the lucid current of the discriminative knowledge belonging to Goodness (sattva), free from the impurities of pain, and abiding in supreme wisdom, the high pedestal of Vasikaara Dispassion (vide above). And this undisturbed discriminative knowledge is the cause of avoidance, whence follows the burning up of the seeding faculty of false knowledge, which thus ceases to procreate. This is the highway of Emancipation, the means of the avoidance (of pain).",
"27. <b>Sutra:</b> For him the consciousness to the utmost stage is seven-fold.<p>'For him' refers to one who has discriminative knowledge. 'Seven-fold'--On the removal of the enveloping impurities Buddhi, no further cognition being brought about,--the consciousness of the vise one becomes only seven-fold. These grades are: (1) The avoidable has been known, there is nothing more of it to be known; (2) the causes of the avoidable (pain) have been attenuated, there is nothing more of them to be attenuated; (3) the avoidance has been directly perceived by means of suppressive meditation; (4) the means of avoidance in the shape of discriminative knowledge has been accomplished. Such is the four-fold effected end of consciousness. The end of mind again is threefold : (1) The office of spiritual consciousness has been fulfilled; (2) the attributes devoid of rest like stones fallen from the mountain-top, turned towards dissolution into their cause, disappear together therewith; and of these dissolved ones there is no more production, for want of any purpose--(3) in this state, the spirit, outgrowing all attributive connection, pure and shining in his own pristine form, becomes isolated.<p>The spirit, witnessing this seven-fold consciousness, to its utmost stage, is called 'Adept.' And even on the retrograde procreation of the mind, be is emancipated and becomes 'adept,' because of his having gone beyond the range of the attributes.",
"28. Discriminative knowledge becomes the means to avoidance, only when fully accomplished; and since this accomplishment is not possible without some means, therefore now commences the consideration of such means.<p><b>Sutra:</b> On the decay of impurity through the practice of the accessories of yoga, there is an enlightenment of consciousness, till discriminative knowledge is accomplished.<p>'Accessories of yogas': the eight, about to be described; through the practice or these, results the decay of impurity in the shape of the five-fold misconception; and on this decay, results the manifestation of right knowledge. As the accessories come to be practised, the impurity becomes gradually attenuated; and as this decay, so is the increase of the brightness of consciousness, dependent upon the order of the decay; and this brightness goes on gradually increasing 'till discriminative knowledge results'--that is to say till the recognition of the nature of the Spirit and the Attributes.<p>The practice of the accessories of Yoga is the cause of the disjunction of impurity, as the axe is of the (disjunction of the) object cut; and it is the cause of the attainment of discriminative knowledge, as virtue is of pleasure; and in no way can it be a cause. How many are these causes said to be in science? They are nine--e.g. (l) Utpattikarana the originative (2) Sthitikarana (fixitive), (3) abhivyaktikarana (manifestive), (4) vikarakarana (modificatory), (5) Pratyayakarana (cognitive), (6) Viyogakarana (disjunctive), (8) Anyatvakarana (Differentiative), and (9) Dhritikarana (up-holding). To exemplify severally--(1) the mind of consciousness; (2) the soul's purpose of the mind, and food of the body; (3) light and the consciousness thereof, of form or colour; (4) other objects, of the mind, and fire of the food to be cooked; (5) the knowledge of smoke, of the knowledge of fire; (6) the practice of yogic accessories, of discriminative knowledge; (7) the same practice, of impurity; (8) the goldsmith of the gold; and similarly of a single mental function [vritti (feminine)], Ignorance is the cause of its stupefaction; aversion of its painfulness, desire of its pleasurableness, true knowledge of its impartiality; (9) the body of the sense-organs, and vice versa, the great elements of the bodies, and these latter of one another,--the animal, the human and the divine bodies upholding one another. These are the nine causes. As occasion presents itself, these are to be applied to other objects also. But the causal efficiency of the practice of the accessories of yoga is only two-fold (i.e., the disjunctive and the procuring, as mentioned above before the enunciation of the forms of causality).",
"29. The accessories of yoga are next described:<p><b>Sutra:</b> Restraint (or Forbearance), Observance, Posture, Regulation of Breath, Abstraction, Concentration, Contemplation, and Meditation--are the eight accessories.<p>We shall now describe in due order, the form and practice of these.",
"30. <b>Sutra:</b> Forbearance consists in harmlessness, truth, abstinence from theft, continence and freedom from avarice.<p>Of these 'harmlessness' is in no way and at no time wishing ill to any living being. The following restraints and observances have all of them abstinence for their root, and being included in its accomplishment, are performed only for the proper performance thereof;-- they are practised only in order to clarify the aforesaid abstinence. It has been thus declared: 'As the Brahmana performs many penances, so does he become alienated from the cause of harm to others and thus brings about the same harmlessness duly clarified.'<p>'Truth--consists in word and mind corresponding to facts--that is word and mind both tallying with objects as see, inferred or heard (from authentic sources). A word is spoken for the transference of one's thought to another, and as such if it is not deceptive or mistaken, or devoid of comprehension (unable to be comprehended by the listener), (then it is true); it is so only when it is used for the good of others, and not for their evil. If being spoken as such (as a truth) it leads to the injury of others, then it would not be truth; it would be a sin; and by this semblance of virtue (the agent) would suffer endless trouble. Therefore one ought to tell the truth with a due consideration of the good of all beings.<p>Theft consists in the acceptance of objects from others, in a manner contrary to the prescribed forms (of gift). The abstinence from this in the shape of absence of desire therefore, is 'Asteya'.<p>'Continence'--the control of the secret generative organs.<p>'Freedom from avarice' consists in the non-acceptance of any objects, on account or a due sense of the discrepancies therein, in the shape of trouble attendant upon its acquirement, protection, waste or consumption, attachment, and malevolence (towards other competitors).",
"31. These, however, are--<p><b>Sutra:</b> the Great Penance, when in all stages, the above are not conditioned by (are irrespective of) class, place, time and convention.<p>Of these, harmlessness conditioned (or limited) by class--the killing of fish, and nothing else, by fishermen (which is wrongly tolerated by people). Conditioned by place--as 'I will not kill in a sacred place'; conditioned by time-- 'I will not kill on the 14th day of the fortnight or on other sacred day'; and lastly the harmlessness conditioned by convention, [belonging to one who is above the three kinds of 'slaughter' just mentioned],--as 'I shall kill (animals) for the sake of the gods and the Brahmanas, and not otherwise'; or again killing is allowable for the warrior caste, in battle, and nowhere else. Harmlessness and the rest, not conditioned by these--class, place, time and convention--are to be always practised, in all stages--i.e., with regard to all objects; and this being free from any sort or restriction, they are called the Great Penance, belonging to all stages.",
"32. <b>Sutra:</b> The observances are--purification, contentment, penance, study and devotion to the Lord.<p>Of these, 'purification' the external, consists in the removal of impure objects by means of clay and water etc., and the internal, in the removal of the impurities of the mind. 'Contentment'--the absence of any desire for acquiring things other than those that are near at hand. 'Penance'-- the bearing of the pair of opposites,--such as hunger and thirst, heat and cold, sitting and standing, complete and formal silence8 (the former consisting in not expressing one's ideas even by gestures, and the latter in mere absence of articulate speech); and the penances proper, are the Krichhra, the Chandrayana etc., 'Study'--the study of the sciences dealing with emancipation, or the repetition of the Pranava. 'Devotion to the Lord'--the offering of all actions to the supreme and venerable. 'Seated on the bed or wandering on the road, if he is calm on having his doubts and misgivings removed, and looking upon the destruction of the seed of metempsychosis,--such a one would be the eternally emancipated, the experiencer of the joys of immortality.' In this connection it has been declared: 'Thence the right knowledge of the retrograde sentience, and the removal of obstacles' (Sutra 1.29)",
"33. Of these, when Restraints and Penances--<p><b>Sutra:</b> ... are obstructed by questionables, the constant pondering of the opposites (is necessary).<p>When the Brahmana is obsessed by the questionables,-- harmlessness and the rest (to be described in the next aphorism),--such as 'I will kill my malefactor,' 'I shall tell an untruth,' 'I shall take hold of his property.' 'I will be vulgar with his wife,' 'I will be master of his holdings,'-- he becomes obstructed by the glaring fever of questionables leading to evil ways, the neophyte is to ponder over the opposites thereof--i.e., he should think thus: Boiled in the terrific fire of metempsychosis I have taken refuge in the virtues of yoga, through charity and love towards all beings; so if I revert to the questionable paths after having once given them up, then I would be acting like a miserable cur--reverting to the relinquished, just as the dog licks up the vomited food. The same process is to be applied to the other aphorisms as well (i.e., those treating of purification and the rest).",
"34. <b>Sutra:</b> The questionables are slaughter (harmfulness) and the rest; (and whether these are) done, caused to be done, or approved of (abetted); (whether) preceded by (caused by) covetousness, anger or delusion; (whether) slight, moderate or excessive,-- they (always) have pain and ignorance for their endless fruits--thus is the pondering upon (their) opposites.<p>Slaughter is three-fold, being either done, caused to be done, or abetted,-- each of these again is three-fold: (l) caused by covetousness i.e., for the sake of the flesh or the skin; (2) by anger--i.e., thinking the object to be one's injuror; (3) by delusion--thinking that virtue will result therefrom (as the slaughter in sacrifices). Covetousness8 anger and delusion too are three fold: being slight, moderate or excessive. Thus there are 27 forms of slaughter. The slight etc., again are each threefold: the slight, the moderate-slight, and the excessive-slight; and again the slight-moderate, the moderate-moderate, the excessive-moderate; and lastly the slight-excessive, the moderate-excessive and the excessive-excessive. Thus slaughter becomes, eighty-one-fold. Again in accordance with decision, doubt and collectivity (1) when it is decided that fish is to be killed (2) when it is doubtful whether the fish or the goat is to be killed; and (3) when both of them are to be killed, it becomes innumerable, because of the innumerability of living beings. The same divisions are to be applied to untruth and the rest also.<p>'These questionables have pain and ignorance for their endless fruits'--thus is to be the pondering upon their opposites--e.g., the killer first of all cripples the powers of the animal to be slaughtered (by binding it fast to some pole then gives it pain by letting fall some weapon, and then deprives it of its life even. Then from crippling of its power results the crippling of the powers of the killer's accoutrements (or accessories), both animate (wife etc.) and inanimate (bed, food etc.); from the animals pain results his own misery in hell, and daring future brute existence (the necessary consequence of slaughter); and the loss of life leads to his continuous existence on the brink of death (on account of some incurable disease) (during which state), though wishing to be dead, he still breathes, on account of there being a fixed time for fruition of pain (as death would save him).<p>Editor: from 1934 edition<p>This same process should, as far as possible, be applied to Untruthfulness and other Counter-intents also.<p>By pondering over these undesirable results as following from all the counter-intents, the man should never allow his mind to be turned towards these counter-intents. Thus from the cause, in the shape of the pondering of their antitheses, follows the effect that the counter-intents become discarded.", 
"35. Editor: from 1934 edition<p>When for the Yogin, these counter-intents have become unproductive (by being discarded), then there accrues to him, (from the due practices of the Restraints and Observances) a certain power, which is indicative of his success. For example--<p><b>Sutra:</b> When Benevolence becomes confirmed, there is suspension of hostility near him.<p>All living beings give up all hostility.",
"36. Editor: from 1934 edition<p><b>Sutra:</b> When Truthfulness becomes confirmed, he becomes the bestower of rewards for actions.<p>When a Yogin says to a man 'Be righteous,' the man actually becomes righteous; if he says to him 'may you attain Heaven,' the man actually attains Heaven. In fact, the Yogin's word becomes infallible.",

"38. <b>Sutra:</b> Continence being confirmed, the attainment of vigour.<p>By the attainment of this, the Yogi raises to perfection the irrepressible qualities (the powers); and becoming perfected he is able to infuse wisdom into his disciples.",
"39. <b>Sutra:</b> Non-covetousness being confirmed, knowledge of the how and wherefore of births.<p>Supply 'accrue to him.' 'Who was I? How was I? What is this (birth)? How is this? What shall I be? How shall I be?'--Such longings after knowing all about his past, present, and future births, become by themselves satisfied.",
"40. Now we speak with regard to the Observances.<p><b>Sutra:</b> From purity, for one's own body and non-intercourse with others.<p>Being disgusted with his body the Yogi begins purifications; but finding the body to be full of discrepancies, he loses all attachment thereto, and thus becomes 'self-controlled' (Yati). And further (there is) 'non-intercourse with others'--looking upon the nature of the body, and desiring to give up his own body on account of not finding it purified even on being washed with clay and water,--how can such a one have intercourse with the extremely dirty bodies of others?",
"41. And also<p><b>Sutra:</b> Purity, complacency, concentration, subjugation of the senses, and fitness for communion with the Spirit--(all accruing) to the thinking principle (Lit. Goodness).<p>From purification results the purity of the thinking principle (mind), thence its complacency, thence its concentration, thence its subjugation of the senses, and finally its fitness for spiritual communion,--all these result from the confirmation of purity.",
"42. <b>Sutra:</b> From contentment, superlative felicity.<p>As has been declared: 'Whatever constitutes the desirable pleasure in this world, and whatever great pleasure there is in heaven,--all these do not compare with the sixteenth part of the felicity attendant upon the suppression of desires.'",
"43. <b>Sutra:</b> From penance, after the decay of impurities, the occult powers of the body and the senses.<p>As soon as penance is accomplished, it destroys the enveloping impurity; and from the removal of this enveloping impurity result the occult powers of the body (Buoyancy and the rest) and of the senses (hearing and seeing at great distances etc.)",
"44. <b>Sutra:</b> From study, communion with the desired deity.<p>To one given to study, the Gods, the sages and the perfections, all become perceptible, and are ready for his actions.",
"45. <b>Sutra:</b> From devotion to the Lord, the accomplishment of meditation.<p>Meditation is accomplished for who has offered up all his connections with the Lord; and by this accomplishment, he rightly knows all that is good for him, in other places, in other bodies and at other time; thence his consciousness perceives all things rightly.",
"46. Restraints and observances, together with the attendant powers, have been described; we now speak of Posture of the rest.<p><b>Sutra:</b> Posture is that which is steady and easy.<p>And there are: the (1) Padmasana (lotus) (2) Veerasana (heroic), (3) Bhadrasana (decent), (4) Svastikasana (like the mystic sign) (5) Dandasana (staff) (6) Sopashrayasana (supported) (7) Paryankasana (bedstead) (8) Krauncha-nishadasana (seated heron), (9) Hastanishadasana (seated elephant), (10) Ushtranishadasana (seated camel), (11) Samasansthanasana (evenly balanced), (12) Sthirasukhasana (the steady and pleasant) i.e., in accordance with one's pleasure, and so forth.",
"47. <b>Sutra:</b> By slackening of effort, and the contemplation of the infinite.<p>Supply--'it (posture) is accomplished.' On the cessation of effort, posture is accomplished; and there is no quivering of the body. Or, the mind contemplating on the Infinite accomplishes Posture.", 
"48. <b>Sutra:</b> Thence, Non-Embarrassment by the pairs (of opposites).<p>By the accomplishment posture, the Yogi is not embarrassed by the pairs of opposites--such as heat and cold etc.", 
"49. <b>Sutra:</b> Thereupon, the Regulation of Breath,-- the controlling of the course of inspiration and expiration.<p>By the accomplishment posture, results the Regulation of Breath, which consists in the interruption (stoppage) in the course of inspiration (the inhaling and expiration (the exhaling of the inhaled air).",
"50. And that again<p><b>Sutra:</b> is an external, internal or stationary function,--regulated by place, time and number,-- protracted or subtile (long or short).<p>The interruption, preceded by expiration, is external; and that again, preceded by in inspiration, is internal; the absence of both is the third, the stationary function, attainable by a single effort; just as a drop of water placed on a heated stone-slab, becomes shrivelled from all sides, so is the absence of the two (inspiration and expiration). All these three are 'regulated by place',--'This particular place is its object'; 'regulated by time'--as characterised by the measures of time; 'regulated of number'--the first stroke is to consist of so many inspirations and expiration; in the same manner the second stroke of the overpowered (breath) is to consist of so many; in the same manner the third, the slight, so the moderate, so the excessive,--such is the regulation by number. And this regulation of Breath when practised, is protracted or subtile (long or short).",
"51. <b>Sutra:</b> The fourth is dependent on the recognition of the outer and inner spheres.<p>The 'outer sphere' regulated by place, time and number being passed over, so also the inner sphere regulated in the same manner, being passed over,--both being protracted as well as subtile--that which is preceded by these, and consists of the subjugation of the stages in the social stoppage of then two,--is the fourth kind of Regulation of Breath. The third is the interruption untouched by any object, no sooner began than regulated by place, time and number,--being protracted and subtile; and the fourth is the interruption preceded by the indication of the first two, brought forth by the subjugation of the stages, through the recognition of the objects of exhalation and inhalation; such is the difference between the 3rd and 4th (the third is not preceded by the cognition or any object, and is brought about by a single effort, whereas the fourth is preceded by the recognition of objects and is only amenable to long continued effort).",
"52. <b>Sutra:</b> Then is destroyed the envelope of light.<p>Of the Yogi practising the regulation of breath, the action enveloping right knowledge is destroyed. This is thus described--'The net of great delusion enveloping the illuminative goodness, turns it towards evil deeds.' This light-enveloping and birth-causing action of the Yogi is attenuated by the practice of the regulation of breath, and is decaying every moment. As has been declared: 'There is no penance above the regulation of breath; because there-from results the removal of impurities and the illumination of knowledge.'",
"53. And also,<p><b>Sutra:</b> the fitness of the mind for concentration.<p>This also results from regulation of breath alone, in accordance with the aphorism: 'Or by the expulsion and retention of breath'(Aph. 1.34)",
"54. Now what is Abstraction?<p><b>Sutra:</b> Abstraction is the assumption, as it were, by the senses of the original nature of the mind, from want of application to their (respective) objects.<p>On the absence of application to their respective objects, results the 'assumption, as it were, of the original nature of the mind'--that is to say, on the suppression of the mind, the senses also becoming suppressed, do not stand in need of any other means, like the control of other senses (i.e., one sense being suppressed by a certain means, the subjugation of other senses stands in need of other means;) but on the suppression of the mind, that of the senses follows directly. Just as the bees fly along with the chief of the black bees, and rest after he has rested, so on the suppression of the mind, the senses become subjugated--and this constitutes Abstraction.",
"55. <b>Sutra:</b> Thence the complete subjugation of the senses.<p>'The subjugation of the senses consists in the non-hankering after the various sensuous objects, sound and the rest'--so say some. Hankering is attachment, that which alienates the agent from his advancement. The applications not contradictory (to scripture) is allowable (so this application, free from any that is contradictory to the scripture, constitutes subjugation, according to others). The optional communion with objects (is subjugation)--say others. (That is, the senses turning towards and touching objects only when desired by the agent). Others again assert the subjugation of the senses to consist in perception of sound and the rest, free from pleasure and pain, through the absence of attachment and aversion. It is total non-perception (absence of sensation) due to concentration--says Jaigishavya. Thence (from abstraction) follows this highest form or subjugation-- viz., suppression of the mind, the senses being subjugated it does not, as in the case of subjugation of the senses, stand in need of any other means due to any effort of the Yogi."

"1. The five outer means having been described, the author now proceeds to explain Concentration.<p><b>Sutra:</b> Concentration is the fixing of the mind to a certain locality.<p>It is the fixing of the mind solely through its function, on the navel, the lotus of the heart, the light in the brain, the tip of the nose, and the tip of the tongue etc., or on external objects.",
"2. <b>Sutra:</b> Contemplation consists in the uninterrupted current of cognition thereof.<p>i.e., the uniform flow in that place (mentioned in the previous aphorism) of the cognition reposing in the object contemplated. That is to say, contemplation is untouched by any other cognition.", 
"3. <b>Sutra:</b> The same, enlightening the object alone, and devoid of its own identity as it were, is Meditation. When Contemplation is conscious of the form of the object, and appears as if devoid of its own character of consciousness, then on account of its being infused with the character of the contemplated object, it becomes meditation.",
"4. These three Concentration, Contemplation and Meditation together constitute Samyama:<p><b>Sutra:</b> The three together constitute Samyama.<p>The three means having a single object, are called Samyama, which thus is the technical name for the three taken collectively.",
"5. <b>Sutra:</b> From success therein results the lucidity of consciousness.<p>By mastering Samyama, results the lucidity of meditative consciousness. As Samyama becomes established so does meditative consciousness become lucid.",
"6. <b>Sutra:</b> It is applied by stages.<p>Samyama is applied to another stage only when it has mastered the preceding one. Samyama can never attain to the final (highest) stage, by jumping over the intermediate stages, without conquering these latter. (The condition of the perceived object being the lowest stage, that of the organ of perception the intermediate stage, and that of the perceiver, the final stage). And without its attaining to the highest stage, whence the lucidity of consciousness? For one who has through divine favour conquered the following stages, it is not necessary to practise Samyama with regard to the preceding ones. Why? Because the objects of this latter will have already been cognised through the former. In the knowledge of the order of the stages--that this stage preceded that--yoga is the only guide. Why? Because it has been declared: 'Yoga is to be recognised by yoga; from yoga does yoga proceed; one who is not confused by yoga, he ever delights in yoga.'",
"7. <b>Sutra:</b> The three are more intimate (directly effective) than the former ones. The three--Concentration, Contemplation and Meditation--are more directly effective in accomplishing concrete meditation, than the former ones, Restraint and the rest.",
"8. <b>Sutra:</b> It is still foreign to the seedless. (Abstract).<p>The preceding intimate triad of means is foreign to the seedless (abstract) meditation; Why? Because Abstract meditation appears only when the three are absent.",
"9. <b>Sutra:</b> Suppressive (or interceptive) modification is the conjunction of the mind with the moment of suppression, on the overthrow and prevalence of the distractive (waking) and suppressive impressions (respectively).<p>The distractive impressions being the properties (material effects) of the mind, are not identical with cognition, and as such are not suppressed by the suppression of the cognition (in fact, they always outlive the cognitions of which they are the impressions; it is only the material cause whose suppression causes that of the effect also); the suppressive impressions also are properties of the mind; --the (respective) 'overthrow and prevalence' of these--i.e., when the distractive impressions are vesting, and the suppressive impressions also are gaining ground, then the moment of suppression conjoins with the mind. Thus the constant change or impressions, occurring in the mind is suppressive modification. And then the mind has only the impressions left behind,--as has been explained under suppressive (abstract) Meditation (1.18).",
"10. <b>Sutra:</b> Its flow becomes tranquil from residual habit.<p>From suppressive residua results the tranquil flow of the mind, which depends on the expertness in the practice of suppressive residua. When those residua become dulled, the residua having suppression for their property are over-thrown by those whose property is distraction.",
"11. <b>Sutra:</b> The destruction and enlivenment (respectively) of the multi-functionality and concentration of the mind is (its) meditative modification.<p>Multi-functionality is property of the mind, and so is Concentration; the meaning is that there is destruction or decay of multifunctionality and enlivenment or rise of Concentration; both of these are correlated to the mind which holds them as its properties. Thus this mind, correlated to its co-natural (or identical) properties,--the aforesaid decay and rise,--becomes collected or pacified; and this is its meditative modification.",
"12. <b>Sutra:</b> Then again, the concentrative modification of the mind is that in which both the repressed and the revived are equally recognised.<p>Of one whose mind is pacified, the foregoing cognition is the repressed, and the following one similar thereto is the revived; and the meditative mind, correlated to the two is the same (i.e., collected or concentrated). This is the concentrative modification of the mind to which the cognitions are related as its properties.",
"13. <b>Sutra:</b> This also explains the modifications of property, time and condition, in the elementary substances and sense-organs.<p>This--i.e., the aforesaid modifications of the mind--explains the modifications in the elementary substances and the sense-organs,--of property, time and condition.<p>Of these the 'modification of property' consists in the repression and rise of the distractive and suppressive properties in the object having those properties (i.e., in their respective causes).<p>The 'modification of time' is the suppression of its three-fold character--i.e., characterised by the three limitations (of time). This suppression, first of relinquishing the limitation of futurity, and not passing over its property-ness, becomes conjoined with the limitation of the present, wherein it becomes manifested in its true colour. This is its second limitation; nor is this disjointed from the limitation of the past and future. Similarly, distraction (the waking state), of threefold character--i.e., characterized by the three limitations (of time),-- relinquishing the limitation of the present, and not passing over its property-ness, becomes conjoined with the limitation of the past;--this is its third limitation; nor is this disjointed from the limitations of the present and the future. Similarly again, distraction becoming accomplished, and (thereby) relinquishing its limitation of futurity, and not passing over its property-ness becomes related to the limitation of the present, wherein its manifesting in its true colours, begins its operations. This is its second limitation; nor does it get free from 'be limitation. of the past and the future. So again suppression, and also distraction.<p>In the same manner, the 'modification of condition'-- (is that) wherein, during the moments of suppression, the suppressive residua are strengthened, and the distractive residua are weakened. This is the modification of the condition or the properties.<p>Among these, the modification of the object having the properties, is by means of these properties; that of the properties is by means of the limitations; and lastly that of the limitations by means of the conditions.<p>Thus the function of the attributes does not even for a moment exist without the modifications of property, time and condition (i.e., it is constantly producing modifications); because the function of the attributes is ever mobile; and the cause of operation has been said to be the subordinate character of the attributes.<p>Thus in the elementary substances and the sense-organs, owing to the distinction between the property and the object having it, there are three kinds of modifications. In reality however, the modification is one only. Because the property is only a form of the object possessing it; and as such the above is only the consideration of certain modifications of the object, through the properties (i.e., through the modifications of the properties). Hence, during the past, present and future states, what becomes of the property present in the object (which holds it) is only a change in its position (form), and not any change of the (constituent) matter. As for example, to a golden vessel on being broken, and made to undergo a change, the only change that happens is that of form, and not that of the gold itself.<p>Says another (the Banddha holding the complete identity of the property and the object possessing it): 'The object is nothing more than the property, in as much as it does not go beyond the former material; for if the object continued its existence through the various modifications (of the property), then it would in reality become unchangeable.'<p>(To this we make the following reply:)--There is no harm in this. Why? Because, we do not assert its absoluteness. Thus all the three worlds recede from manifestation (i.e., recede from present activity become the past), simply because of the denial of the (unchangeable) eternity (of mundane objects). And though receded (become past), still it exists, because of denial of its destruction; its minuteness is due to its correlation (i.e., resolution into its cause); and from its minuteness results imperceptibility. The property, having the modification of time, existing in the various limitations (lakshana, of time), becoming past, and thus becoming conjoined with the limitation of the past, is not disjoined from the limitations of the present and the future; similarly the future, joined to the limitation of the future, is not disjoined from those of the past and present; and lastly the present, joined to the limitation of the present, is not disjoined from those of the past and the future. (That is to say every individual limitation is accompanied by the other two.) Just as, because a man is attached to a certain woman, it does not follow that he has an aversion for other women.<p>Here, in the modification of time (limitation), all the limitations occurring together, there would result an admixture of limitations. If this is urged as an objection, then we make the following reply: The character of the property having been established, we have to describe its different limitations; for certainly its special character belongs to the property not only at the present time, (but it has the same character even in the past and the future). For otherwise the mind would not have attachment for its property, because attachment does not exist when there is anger. And further, the simultaneous relation of any individual with the three limitations, is not possible; by degrees however there is the manifestation of it, by means of its manifesting cause. As has been declared: 'The excessive manifestation, of forms and those of functions are opposed to one another, but the genuine ones act in consort with the excessive manifestations' (vide this quotation under 2.15). Therefore, there no admixture (as has been urged by the objector).<p>As from the activity of attachment with regard to a certain object, it is not inferred that it does not exist anywhere else,--the fact being that it is related to the latter too, in a general way,--so the same is the case with limitation (lakshana): It is the property, and not the object possessing the property, that has the three limitations: The properties, manifested (present) as well as well as unmanifested, (past and future), attaining to the various conditions (of weakness, strength and the like), are said to have been changed--but this change is only in (condition), not in matter. Just as a single line in the place of hundreds, becomes hundred, in the place of tens a ten, and in the place of units a unit; and again, as a single woman is called mother, daughter and mother-in-law (according to circumstances, the woman remaining the same).<p>Against the theory of the 'modification of conditions,' some people have raised the objection that in that case there would be an unchangeable eternality (for objects and their properties); because, a property is said to be in the future when, being from the range of the activity of the limitation, it does not out its own operations; when it carries on its operations, it is said to be in the present, and lastly, when it has ceased after having operated, it is to be in the past.-- And thus we find that the limitations and the conditions of the properties and the objects having them are unchangeably eternal. This is the objection urged.<p>(We reply): This is not a sound objection; because though the object having an attribute is eternal, yet there is quite a variety of the forms of the suppression (or over-throw) of the attributes themselves; just as the destructible (suppressible), agglomeration (earth and the rest) is a mere property of the indestructible (irrepressible) sound, odour etc. (rudimentary elements); similarly the repressible mergent (Linga, the Buddhi) is a mere property of the irrepressible (Attributes) Goodness and the rest. Thus their modification is attributed to these (i.e., the properties Buddhi, Earth etc.). Here we have the following instance: The object clay, acquiring a property other than that of a lump, becomes modified by the property, into the form of a jar; and this form of the jar, relinquishing the future limitation, attains to the present one, and thus becomes modified by limitation; and lastly, the jar momentarily becoming new and old, acquires the modification of condition. The change of the properties of an object is a condition; and the change in the limitation of the property is also a condition; thus the change in matter is only one (i.e., the modification of condition); but this has been shown in its various divisions (i.e., though there is in fact only one modification, that of condition, still the other two--that of property and limitation have been explained separately, though really being the only particular forms of that of condition alone). The same consideration is to be applied to all other objects.<p>All these modifications of property and limitation and condition never outgrowing the form of the object, the modification is one alone, and this includes all the other particular ones.<p>Now what do you mean by 'modification'? Modification consists in the appearance of fresh properties for a certain object, following on the cessation (or repression) of the former ones.", 
"14. Among these--<p><b>Sutra:</b> The subject is that which is correlated to the properties of tranquility, activity, and latency (indescribability).<p>The property is only the faculty of the subject, characterised by capability; and its existence being inferred from the variety of its effects, it is found to be manifold with regard to the one subject.<p>Of these the present (active) property, its own activity, becomes differentiated from the other properties,--the tranquil (past) and the latent (future) ones. When however it is correlated only in a general form, then consisting merely of the form of the subject, wherefrom should it differentiate? Thus the properties of the subject are three--the tranquil, the active and the latent. Of these the tranquil are those that have receded after having done their work; those that are operating are the active; both of these precede the future; the past precedes the present. Wherefore are not the present one to precede the ones? Because among these two there is no order of precedence; as the order or precedence that we find between and past the future is not found in the case of the past with regard to the present. Therefore there is nothing that precedes the past. For this reason the future precedes the present (this in accordance with the theory of the continued existence of the effect latent in the cause, before its manifestation).<p>Now which are the latent ones? (Reply) Everything having the character of everything. With regard to this it is declared: 'Among the immovable objects we find universality of the effects in the form of the different tastes, belonging to Water and Earth; similarly of the immovables with regard to the movable, and vice versa'. Thus the genes not being suppressed (or else the various effects would not be recognised), everything has the nature of everything. Though this is so, yet their manifestation is not simultaneous, because of the manifestation being conditioned by place, time, and form. That which is correlated to these manifested and unmanifested properties, and which has both the general (belonging to the subject) and the special character (of the property),--such a correlative is the subject. One (the Yogachara) however who asserts the property to be unconnected (with anything else, because he denies the existence of any subject other than the properties of cognition and the like), for him there would be no experience. Why? Because the actions performed by a certain idea (or cognition) cannot transfer its effect to the other idea (for according to these theorists there is nothing except ideas, and these are momentary); and again there could be no memory of the action; for an object seen by one (idea) cannot be remembered by another. Because of the recognition of objects (previously perceived), there must be a subject correlative (to the various modifications of the object), which is recognised the same, after its properties have undergone a change. Therefore it cannot be rightly held that all that exists is mere unconnected property.", 
"15. <b>Sutra:</b> The change of order is the cause of versatility (or changeableness) of modifications.<p>'The modification of one subject should be one only'--this being urged, (we reply) that the change order can be the cause of the versatility of the modifications. As for instance, the proper order is--dust of clay, lump of clay, the jar-clay, the clay of the broken jar, and the clay of the small pieces. The proper order is the mention of the following property next to the one that precedes it--e.g., the lump disappearing, the jar appears--such is the order of the modification of property. The order of the modification of limitation--as the present state of the jar after its future, the past state of the lump after its present; as for the past, there is no order because when there is succession, then only can there be an order; but there is no succession of the past; therefore there is order only of the first two limitations (the present and the future). Similarly the order of the modification of condition--e.g.,--the oldness of the jar after its newness; and this oldness being manifested by the order of the series of moments, attains to final manifestation. This is the third modification, above those of the property and its limitation.<p>These various orders, acquiring their form on the differentiation of the subject and the property,--certain properties also become subjects with reference to certain other properties. When however there is the idea of identity (of the property) in the subject,--and thus that property being mentioned thereby (i.e., by naming the subject),--then the order appears to be one only. Of the mind, the properties are two-fold-- the perceived and the unperceived; of these the former are the cognitions, and the latter, the objects themselves. These, having their objective character got at by means of inference are seven: (l) suppression (the state of absolute meditation inferred from the disappearance of all residua), (2) Virtue (and vice, inferred from the resulting pleasure and pain), (3) Residual Impressions (inferred from memory), (4) Modification (inferred from the mobility of the attributes), (5) Life (the effort to live inferred from breathing), (6) Movements (action inferred from the activity of the various senses), and (7) Capability or Power (the latent condition of the effects, existing in their causes),--these are the seven properties of the mind, devoid of perception.",
"16. Henceforward begins the consideration of the objects of samyama, for the accomplishment of the ends of the yogi equipped with all the accessories.<p><b>Sutra:</b> The knowledge of the past and future (is acquired) through samyama over the three modifications.<p>From samyama over the modifications of property, time and condition, accrues to the yogi the knowledge of the past and the future. Samyama has been defined as consisting in concentration, contemplation and meditation taken together. Hence the three modifications being perceived, the yogi accomplishes the knowledge of the past and future related thereto.",
"17. <b>Sutra:</b> The word, the object denoted by it and its idea are commingled with one another, on account of their being mistaken for one another; hence by samyama over the distinct provinces of each of these, (arises) the comprehension of the cry of all creatures.<p>The organ of speech has its purpose solely with the letter pronounced; the organ of hearing has the modification of sound for its object; and the word finally is perceptible through the apprehension of the letters taken collectively. The letters, not coming in simultaneously, and hence not aided by one another, do not affect the word; and as such not giving rise to (any idea), but each of them appearing and disappearing by turns--are severally said to be incapable of forming the word. Every one of the letters, forming a word, --capable of a host of denotations (when taken severally), yet when correlated with the accompanying letters, and hence becoming manifold, become so placed that each of them is confined to the particular word by the other [i.e., the single letter ga has the capability of denoting gau, gaNa, gaura etc., so long as it is taken by itself; but as soon as the letter ga is joined with the letters au etc., it becomes manifold; and each of the two letters serves to confine the other to the particular word in question. Thus (we see that) the various letters, depending on the order of succession become characterised by the convention of meaning, and though capable of all sorts of denotations, yet becoming subordinated to the ga and the au, denote the particular object with the dewlap etc. (i.e. the cow). Thus the cognition of the unity of these,-- as characterised by conventional meaning, and having the order of utterance drawn together (i.e. considered collectively) --is said to be the denotative name for the object named. Thus a single word,--being the object of a single cognition, being put forth by a single effort, devoid of any distinction (between the letters) (and hence also) of the order and of letters, belonging to consciousness, brought forth by the action of the last letter (as helped by the impressions left in the memory, of the preceding ones),--is cognised as a real entity by the popular mind correlated with the impressions of everlasting linguistic usage, by means of the letters, uttered with a view to express the objects to others, and heard by the listener. And the disintegration of this word (into its letters) is due to the notion of convention,--(the popular idea being that) the denotator of the object is such and such a particular arrangement of so many letters.<p>Convention is a form of Remembrance consisting in the idea of the mutual identity between the word and what is denoted by it: that convention is of this form:--the word is the meaning and the meaning is the word (an idea of identity).<p>Thus then; these three--the word, the object denoted by it and the idea,--become commingled on account of being mistaken for another--'cow' the word, 'cow' the object, 'cow' the idea; and one who knows the distinction of these, knows everything. Every word has the force of sentence: the word 'tree' implies its existence; for certainly existence cannot be denied to any object. Similarly there is no action without the means; so the word 'cooks' implies all the agencies pertaining to it; the further mention of the agent, the object and the instruments (Chaitra, the rice and fire) being made only in order to specify these; and further we find single words used for sentences--the word 'srotriya' for 'studies the Vedas,' the word 'lives' for 'holds life.' In a sentence, there is an expression of the meanings of words, (thus there being the expression of the meaning of a sentence in a word, and that of the meaning of the word in a sentence, there is a confusion and) the word is to be broken up (into its constituent parts) and then explained as to which part of it expresses the verb, and which the nominative (as the word srotriya is broken up into 'one (nominative) who studies (verb) the Vedas (accusative).' Or otherwise, in the case of asvah (meaning by itself, both horse and thou breathest) and ajapayah (the milk of the she-goat, and also, thou has suppressed), there being a confusion of the name and the verb (as shown by the two meanings of each), how could these be explained either with regard to the verb (it it were taken as a name) or to the nominative (in case it were taken as a verb)? the distinct province of these word, meaning and idea--e.g., 'the house is whitening'--the word signifying the verb (sveta); and 'the house is white'--hear the word (sveta) signifies the noun (so much for the word); (secondly) its meaning is that consisting in the verb or in the noun; and (thirdly) the idea is that which apprehends the aforesaid meanings. Why? Because in convention the idea has only one form, being based on the identity of the signification-- 'this is that,'--the 'white object' being the object of the word as well as of the idea. [That is to say, in the above example the idea is that of the house in front being a white one, whatever may be the words in which the idea is expressed]. And this object under its modifications is accompanied neither by the word, nor by the idea. Similarly the word and the idea do not accompany each other. The consciousness of the distinct province of each being in the form--'the word is different from the meaning which again is different from the idea.'<p>From the Samyama over this distinction, accrues to the Yogi, the comprehension of the cry of all creatures.", 
"18. <b>Sutra:</b> By the mental presentation of the impressions, the knowledge of previous births.<p>Impressions are of two kinds...(l) Those in the form of the residual longings, the causes of memory and the afflictions, and (2) those in the form of virtue and vice, leading to fruition. Both of these kinds, accomplished in the former birth, are the properties of the mind, imperceptible, like modification, movement, suppression, power, life (the properties of the mind spoken of above in 3.15). The Samyama over these is of rendering the impressions apparent; nor is such presentation possible without cognition of their time, place and cause (of the previous birth). Thus the knowledge of the previous birth accrues to the yogi through the mental presentation of the impressions. In the case of others too there is a similar knowledge of another's birth, following on the mental presentation of their impressions. In connection with this we have a story:--Discriminative knowledge accrued to the revered Jaigishavya, possessing, through the mental presentation of the impressions, a knowledge of the orderly modification of his birth extending over ten Pralayic creations. The revered Avatya, thus spoke to him: 'Through ten Kalpic creations having your consciousness unrepressed, you must have come across the pains due to birth in a hellish or a brutish womb; and being born again and again among men and the gods, which of the two, pleasure and pain, did you find in greater amount?' Jaigishavya thus replied: 'I, having my consciousness unrepressed through ten cycles, and coming across the pain due to hellish and bestial births, and being born again and again among gods and men, whatever I experienced, all I think to be solely pain.' Says the revered Avatya, 'This unsurpassed pleasure of contentment consisting in mastery over Nature that thou hast...dost thou include this also under pain?' Replied the revered Jaigishavya: 'This pleasure of contentment is excellent as compared with sensuous pleasure; in comparison with isolation however, this also is pain. Because this pleasure of contentment is a property of Buddhi, and as such abounds in the three attributes; and all consciousness partaking of the three attributes, has been put under the bead of 'what should be avoided.' Then, contentment is said to be pleasure because the strings of desire being the nature of pain, removal of these, there is unrestricted pleasure.",
"19. <b>Sutra:</b> With reference to cognition, the knowledge of another's mind.<p>From the Samyama over cognition--i.e. from the mental presentation of the cognition (of others), results the knowledge of other's minds.",
"20. <b>Sutra:</b> But not along with its object, that not being the object.<p>The Yogi knows the mind of another, as attached to something; but he does not know 'it is attached to that particular object.' Because that which is the object of another's mind, is not the object of the Yogi's mind; it is only another's cognition (or mind) that is made the object of the mind or the Yogi.",
"21. <b>Sutra:</b> From Samyama with reference to the shape of the body, its visibility being suspended, and thus its connection with ocular light being severed,--there is disappearance.<p>From the Samyama with regard to the shape of the body, the visibility of the shape becomes suppressed; and on this suspension, the connection of the body with the light of (other people's) eyes ceases; and thence results the disappearance of the Yogi. The disappearance of sound and the rest are to be explained in the same manner.",
"22. <em><b>Sutra:</b> is not included as such, and 'the disappearance of sound and the rest are to be explained in the same manner' is considered as part of Vyasa's commentary of the previous verse</em>",
"23. <b>Sutra:</b> Karma is active and dormant; and by Samyama over this, results the knowledge of the end; as also by portents.<p>The Karma resulting in life of two kinds: the active and the dormant; the active is similar to a wet piece of cloth spread over the ground, which dries up in a very short time; whereas the dormant is like the same piece of cloth tied up in a bundle, drying up in a long time; or again, the active is like fire in dry straw helped by the wind, burning it completely in a very short time; and the dormant is similar to the same fire when placed in various parts of the heap of straw, burning it in a long time. In this way the Karma 'of one birth,' bringing about life, is of two kinds--the active and dormant.<p>By Samyama over these, results the knowledge of death. 'As also by portents'--portents are threefold; corporeal; elemental and celestial. Of these the 'corporeal' is that, for instance, when closing the ear one not hear the internal sounds (produced in the stomach by breathing), or when one does not see any light on closing the eyes. Similarly the 'elemental' is that when one beholds the attendants of the Death-god; or when one all on a sudden sees his dead forefathers; and the 'celestial' is that when one suddenly beholds the heaven, or the Perfect Ones, or anything contrary to the ordinary course of events (is a portent). By these portents too one knows his end to be near at hand.",
"24. <b>Sutra:</b> In friendliness and the rest, (superhuman) powers. Friendliness, mercy, and complaisance are the three Emotions or (feelings). Of those, by the feeling of friendliness towards all happy creatures, one acquires the power of friendliness. By feeling mercy for the distressed creatures he acquires the power of mercy. And by feeling a complaisance towards the righteous, he acquires the power of complaisance. The Samyama consisting in meditation (contemplation and concentration) proceeding from these emotions, results in such powers as have their faculties unrepressed. With regard to vicious persons one has indifference, and not any feeling;-- thus in this case there is no meditation and as such no power proceeds from indifference, because of the absence of any Samyama with reference to this.",
"25. <b>Sutra:</b> In powers, the power of the Elephant and the like.<p>From Samyama over the power of the elephant, results elephantine power; from that over the power of Garuda a garuda-like power; and from that over the power of the air, the air-like power.",
"26. <b>Sutra:</b> From the application of the light of the (luminous) disposition, (results) the knowledge of the subtile, the intercepted and the remote.<p>The Extremely Luminous disposition of the mind has already been explained ( in 1.36). The yogi applying the light of this disposition (i.e., the inner light) to the subtile, intercepted or remote objects, acquires the knowledge of these (objects).",
"27. <b>Sutra:</b> From Samyama in the Sun, the knowledge of the worlds.<p>The details of this are as follows: There are seven worlds: From Avichi to the summit of the Meru is the Earth. From the Meru to Dhruva (the Polar star) the Starry Region occupied by the planets, and stars. Above that is the fivefold Celestial Region-- the Mahendra being the third of these, the fourth being the Prajapatya or Maharloka (the Luminous Region); the three-fold Brahma--the Janaloka (productive Region), Tapoloka (Region of austerities) and the Satyaloka (the Region of Truth). These are thus described:-- 'The three-regioned Brahmaloka, then the great Prajapatyaloka, then the Mahendra Heaven, then the Sky with the stars, and lastly the Earth with the various creations.' Placed above the Avichi, are the six great Hellish Regions. Mahakala, Ambarisha, Raurava, Mahsaurava, Kaleya Sutra, and Andhatamisra,--respectively placed in the Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, and Darkness; and in these are born several creatures with long leases of life therein, and who have acquired the experience of pain by their own deeds. Under these are the seven Nether Worlds: Mahatala, Rasatala, Atala, Sutala, Vitala, Talatala, and Patala. This our Earth consisting of the seven continents, is the eighth:- in the centre of which is the Land of the Mountains, the Golden Meru, whose peaks are those of silver, emerald, rock-crystal, gold, and jewels. The Southern region of the sky here is of the colour of the blue lotus through the colour of the emerald peak; the Eastern white, the Western clear, the Northern golden. On the Northern side of this is the Jambu tree, whence this particular continent is called the Jambudwipa. On account of the of the movement of the Sun, it is always touched by night and day. To the North of this are three mountains, four thousand miles high, having blue and white peaks. Within these mountain-ranges are three countries, each 72,000 Miles--Ramanaka, Hiranmaya and the Uttara Kuru. To the South are the Mountains Nishada, Hemakuta and Hima, extending over 4,000 Miles; within these are three countries each 72,000 miles--The Harivansa, Kimpurusha and the Bharata. To the East of Meru are the Bhadraswas extending upto the Gandhamadana mountains; and to the West are the Ketumalas extending upto the Gandhamadana mountains. In the centre is the Ilavrita. Thus are the 8,000 miles on each side of the Meru surrounded by its half (wherefore Meru becomes their centre). Such is the Jambudwipa extending over 200,000 miles; surrounded by the salt Ocean, twice its size. Thenceforth follow the other continents--Saka, Suka, Krauncha, Salmala, Magadha, and Pushkara--each twice the size or the other; as also the seven Oceans--like heaps of oil-seed, interspersed with several mountains--of Sugarcane juice, Wine, Butter, Curd, Gruel, Milk, Pure Water. Thus the seven continents,--resembling so many bangles, surrounded by the seven Oceans, together with the mountains visible and invisible, reach the extent of 4,00,00,00,000 miles.<p>All this with its position fixed, is contained in the Egg, which is the atomic part of Matter, the firefly in the sky. Among the nether regions, in the Oceans, and among the mountains, live Asuras, Gandharvas, Kumaras, Kimpurushas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Bhutas, Pretas, Pisachas, Apasmarakas, Brahmarakshasas, Kushmandas and the Vinayakas. In the continents live the righteous gods and men. The Sumeru is the garden house of the gods. In this are the parks,-- Misra, Nandana, Chaitraratha, and Sumanasa. The assembly of the gods is the Sudharma; their city the Sudarsana, the palace the Vaijayanta.<p>The planets and the Stars, bound to the Pole Star, and having their motions manifested by the constant action of the wind, and placed above the Meru, keep constantly revolving. The inhabitants of the Mahendra are the six Divine Beings-- Tridashas, Agaishwattas, Yamyas, Tushitas, Aparinirmitavasavarti and the Parinirmitavasavarti,--all these Vrindarakas have an irresistible will, endued with the eight powers, Buoyancy and the rest, their span of life extending to a kalpa; they rejoice in sexuality, and are endowed with bodies born without sexual intercourse, have loving apsaras for their wives. In the Prajaptya Maharloka live the five Divine Beings--the Kumudas, the Ribhavas, Pratardanas, of the Anjanabhas, and the Prachitabhas. These having the great elements under their power, live in contemplation upto a thousand Kalpas. In the first, Janaloka, of Brahma, there are the four divine beings, the Brahmapurohitas, the Brahmakayikas, the Brahmamahakayikas, and the Amaras-- these have command over the elements and the sense-organs. In the second, the Tapoloka, of Brahma, there are the three Divine beings--the Abhaswaras, the Mahabhaswaras, and the Satyamahabhaswaras--having command over the elements, the senses and Nature--having their span of life double of one another; all living on contemplation, their semen withheld, their knowledge unobstructed in the higher regions, and in the lower regions having the objects all unveiled to their view. In third, the Satyaloka of Brahma, there are four Divine Beings--the Achyutas, the Suddhanivasas, the Satyabhas, and the Sanjnasanjis. These have no houses of their own, and abiding in themselves, living one over the other, commanding Nature, live so long as the creation lasts. Of these, the Achyutas rejoice in the bliss of argumentative meditation, the Suddhanivasas in the bliss of contemplative meditation, the Satyabhas in the contemplation of pare bliss; and the Sanjnasajnis rejoice in that of pure Egoism. These four exist in the three worlds (i.e., are not mukta.)<p>In fact all these seven worlds belong to Brahma. The disembodied ones and those that have been resolved into Nature however continue in the line of Emancipation and have no place in the ordinary world.<p>All this is to be directly perceived by the yogi, by Samyama in the Sun; as also by that in others. The Samyama is to be practised so long as these are not perceived.", 
"28. <b>Sutra:</b> In the moon, the knowledge of the Starry Regions.<p>Through Samyama in the moon the yogi is to know the position of the Stars.",

"30. <b>Sutra:</b> In the circle of the navel, the knowledge of arrangement of the body.<p>By Samyama in the navel-circle, one is to know the arrangement of the body. In the body there are three humours--Wind, Bile and Phlegm; and there are seven substances--skin, blood, flesh, sinews, bone, marrow and semen-- these being named in order of externality (the most external being placed first).",

"36. <b>Sutra:</b> Experience is the undifferentiated conception of the attribute of goodness and the Spirit which, are quite unconnected; (and this experience) being for another's purpose, the knowledge of the Spirit arises from the Samyama on his own object.<p>The attribute of Sattva belonging to the Buddhi, and being of the nature of illumination, suppresses Rajas and Tamas, which are equally related to Sattva-- and thus develops into the cognition of the difference of the attribute of Sattva and the Purusha. The Spirit, being essentially pure, and solely consisting of intelligence, is absolutely dissimilar to the modifying attribute of Sattva. The undifferentiated conception of these two which are absolutely unconnected, is the Soul's Experience,--all objects being presented to him. This experiential conception of the attribute of Sattva being for another's purpose, is perceptible. That which is distinct therefrom--i.e. the Soul's conception consisting of pure intelligence,--by Samyama over this, there arises knowledge having the Soul for its object. The Soul is not perceived by the spiritual conception constituted by the sattva of Buddhi. In fact it is the Soul itself that perceives the conception based on its own nature; as has been declared-- 'Whereby is one to know the knower? (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad)",
"37. <b>Sutra:</b> Thence proceed intuitional cognition, audition, touch, vision, gustation and olfaction.<p>From intuition proceeds the cognition of the subtile, intercepted, remote, past and future objects; from audition proceeds the hearing of celestial sounds; from touch the cognition of celestial touch; from vision the consciousness of celestial form; from gustation, the cognisance of celestial taste; and from olfaction the cognisance of celestial smell;-- these are produced forever.",
"38. <b>Sutra:</b> These are obstacles in (the way of) meditation; but perfections in the distractive (waking) state.<p>These--i.e. intuition and the rest appearing in one of meditative mind,--become obstacles; because they go against discriminative knowledge; but appearing in those of distracted minds, these are so many perfections.",
"39. <b>Sutra:</b> From relaxation of the cause of bondage, and by a knowledge of the method of passing, (proceeds) the entrance of the mind into another body.<p>Of the fickle and unsteady mind, the confinement in the body is due to the force of karmic residua. The relaxation of this karma is the cause of bondage is brought about by the force of meditation. The knowledge of the method of passing of the mind too is produced by meditation. On the decay of karma, and by the knowledge of the process of his own mind, the yogi infuses his mind into other bodies, after extracting it from his own. The mind thus infused becomes correlated to the senses; just as the bees follow their chief both when flying out and flying in, so the mind entering into another body is followed by the senses.",
"40. <b>Sutra:</b> From the subdual of udana, ascension and non-contact with water, mud, thorns and the like.<p>The function of the aggregate of the senses, characterised by Prana and the rest, constitutes Life. Its action is fivefold: (l) The Prana, extending from the heart and proceeding by the mouth and the nostrils; (2) the Samana, extending to the navel, so called from its leveling tendency; (3) the Apana, extending to the soles of the foot, so called from its declining or descending tendency; (4) the Udana, extending to the head, so called from its ascending tendency; (5) the pervading Vyana. Of these Prana is the chief. From mastery over Udana results non-contact with water, mud, thorns, etc., as also ascension at the time of death. The operator attains to it in the character of Vasi (master).",
"41. <b>Sutra:</b> From mastery over Samyama, effulgence.<p>One who has subdued the Samana burns (after death), by the fire raised out of his own body.",
"42. <b>Sutra:</b> From Samyama over the relation between the organ of hearing and akasa, perfect audition.<p>All auditory organs as also all sound have their abidance in Akasa; as has been declared: 'Those who have their audition extending over equal areas, have it limited to one area' (Panchashikha) (i.e. all organs of hearing exist in Akasa). This is the characteristic of Akasa, as also is unveiledness. Similarly, there being no covering for the unbodied, Akasa comes to have the property of omnipresence. The organ of hearing is inferred from the perception of sound of two persons, deaf and otherwise: one perceives the sound, the other does not. Therefore it is only the organ of hearing which has sound for its object. To one who has practised Samyama over the relation of the organ of hearing and Akasa, accrues perfect audition.",
"43. <b>Sutra:</b> From the Samyama over the relation of the body and Akasa, (results) passage through space, from the acquisition of levity like that of cotton.<p>Wherever there is body, there is also Akasa, because it is this latter that gives it room. The relation between these is that of approach; from having Samyama over this and thereby subduing the relation, and acquiring the levity of light objects like cotton down to the atom, and thereby subduing the aforesaid relation, the yogi becomes buoyant; and by this buoyancy the yogi is able to walk on the surface of water; and also supporting himself by the spider's thread, he wanders in the luminous rays of the Sun; and thence proceeds his unobstructed passage in space.",
"44. <b>Sutra:</b> The external, unthought-of junction (of the mind) is the 'Great Incorporeal'; thence the falling off of the veil of illumination.<p>The junction of the mind outside the body is called the incorporeal Dharana. It is called kalpita (thought of) when it is only the external function of the mind abiding in the body. When on the other hand, it is the external function of the mind outside the body, and as such independent of it,--then it is called the Akalpita (unsought of). Out of these two the yogi by the thought, accomplishes the unsought Great Incorporeal, by means of which he enters other bodies. From this Dharana results the falling of the veil--the threefold function of afflictions and karma, originating in foulness and darkness--of the Buddhic goodness which has the nature of illumination.",
"45. <b>Sutra:</b> Mastery over the elements, from the Samyama with reference to grossness, character, subtlety, concomitance and usefulness.<p>The specific qualities sound and the rest, belonging to the Earth etc., together with the properties of shape and the rest, are named gross; this is the first form of the elements. The second form is their respective generic characteristic:--e.g. shape for the Earth, viscidity for the Water, heat for Fire, velocity for Air, omnipresence for Akasa,--all this is what is included in the term 'character.' The specific forms of these generic ones, are Sound and the rest. As has been declared: 'Of these (elements) included in one class (that of Element), the only differentiation is through their distinguishing properties.' In this system, Substance is the aggregate of the generic and specific characteristics. Because the aggregate exists in a two-fold manner--(1) One in which the distinct names of the constituent members are suppressed--as 'body,' 'tree,' 'forest,' 'crowd' etc.; and (2) that in which the constituent members are mentioned--as 'both men and which one portion are the 'men' and the other the 'gods'; and it is only by means of these two portions, that it is called an 'aggregate.' Again the aggregate may be through difference as well as non-difference, (1) as 'the grove of mangoes', 'a crowd of Brahmanas' (the genitive case always implying difference) ; (2) as 'mango-grove,' 'Brahmana-crowd' (there being non-difference of the aggregate from its constituent members). This again is two-fold: (1) Those that have their constituent members separated from another, and (2) those whose constituent members are not so separated. As examples of the first we have 'forest,' 'crowd' etc. (where the members forming the crowd exist separately); and those of (2) we have, 'tree,' 'body' and the like (which, have these members consisting in themselves). Of these, Substance belongs to this second kind of aggregates--so holds Patanjali. Thus has been explained the 'form.'<p>Now what is the subtile form of these? (Reply:) The Rudimentary Elements, from which the gross Elements take their rise. The only constituent member of these is the atom, consisting of the generic and specific (characteristics); and thus these form an aggregate of the class of those having their constituent members coexisting. The same case holds with all rudimentary elements. This is the third, 'Subtlety.'<p>Now begins (the consideration of) the fourth form of the elements: The attributes being of the nature of illumination, activity and inertness correlated to the character of their respective effects,--are mentioned by the word 'concomitance.'<p>Their fifth form is 'usefulness', fruition; the character of being for the purpose of experience and emancipation belonging to the attributes, and the attributes being related to the elements, gross as well rudimentary, as also to the elemental objects (jar, cow etc.),--all come to have a purpose.<p>Thus then from Samyama over the above-mentioned five forms, results the perception as well as the subdual of these. Of these, by subduing the five elemental forms, the yogi becomes the 'conqueror of the elements'; and therefrom the elements along with Nature follow the dictates of his will-- just as the cow follows its calf.",
"46. <b>Sutra:</b> Therefrom proceed Attenuation and the rest; as also perfection of the body, and the non-destruction of its functions.<p>Of these, Attenuation is that whereby the Yogi becomes atomic; Levity or Buoyancy is that whereby he becomes light; by Illimitability he becomes great: by Prapti (Approach) he touches the moon by the finger-tip; 'Irresistible Will' is the non-frustration of desires, whereby he sinks in and rises to the surface of the earth as in water; by 'Subjection' he becomes the subduer of the elements and other objects, being himself unsubdued by others; by 'Supremacy' he becomes the dispenser of the origin, dissolution and position of the elements; 'Fulfilment of Desires' is the truthfulness of one's determination--i.e. the disposition of the elements and their causes in accordance with his will or determination. Though having the power, he does not change the nature of things (does not make a moon of the sun and so on). Why? Because of their having been determined by the will of the Primeval Perfect Being (God) of the irresistible will. These are the eight Perfections or Occult Powers.<p>'The perfection of the body' will be explained in the next aphorism.<p>'The non-obstruction of its functions'--the earth does not obstruct, by its shape, the actions of the yogi's body, in as much as he enters even the stone; the viscid water wets him not; nor does the hot fire burn him; nor does the fast wind move him; and lastly even in the unveiled Akasa, he has his body veiled, in as much as he is invisible even to the Perfect Ones.",
"47. <b>Sutra:</b> Beauty (symmetry of form), Loveliness, Strength, and Adamantine Toughness (of the body) constitute Bodily Perfection.<p>(The Yogi is) beautiful, lovely, bright, with superb strength, and with an adamantine body.",
"48. <b>Sutra:</b> From Samyama with regard to perception, nature, egoism, concomitance and usefulness, results mastery over the sense-organs.<p>Sound and the rest in their generic and the specific forms, constitute the perceived; the function of the senses with regard to this is perception; and this does not consist in the perception of the generic form alone; for how could the mind perceive any object together With its specific forms which has not been perceived?<p>'Nature'--substance--sense-organ--is the aggregate 'with coexisting constituents,' of the specific and generic (effects) of the Buddhic Sattva which is of the nature of illumination.<p>Their third form is self-consciousness consisting in 'egoism' --the generic form of which the senses are the specific forms.<p>The fourth form are the Attributes, of the nature of Illumination, Activity and Inertness, consisting in ascertainment (the property of Buddhi,) which is constituted by the three attributes;--whereof the sense-organs together with self-consciousness, are the modifications.<p>The fifth form is the character of the Attributes,--that of being for the soul's purpose.<p>From gradually performing Samyama over these five forms, the yogi subdues each of them separately--and from their fivefold conquest proceeds the mastery over the senses.", 
"49. <b>Sutra:</b> Therefrom (proceed) fleetness like that of mind, un-instrumental perception, and complete mastery over Nature.<p>The acquiring of the supernatural movement of the body is 'Fleetness like that of mind.'<p>'Uninstrumental Perception is the functioning of the senses of the Incorporeal (yogi) in accordance with the time, place and object desired by him.<p>'Mastery over Nature' is supremacy over all the modifications of Nature.<p>These three perfections are called 'Honey-like,' and proceed from the aforesaid mastery over the five sense-organs.",
"50. <b>Sutra:</b> Just as one has distinctive knowledge of the attribute of Sattva and Spirit, (their results) supremacy over all conditions, and also omniscience.<p>To one who rejoices in the supreme effulgence (the High Vashikara) of Buddhic goodness freed from all taint of Foulness and Darkness;--and who thus abides solely in the distinctive knowledge of Goodness and Spirit;--to such a one accrues the 'supremacy over all conditions'--i.e., all kinds of attributes, active and passive, repair to the absolute vision of their Lord, the Knower of the Field--(Spirit). 'Omniscience'--the simultaneous discriminative knowledge of the universal attributes, existing in their past, present and future states. This is the Vishoka (Sorrowless) Perfection, by attaining to which, the yogi becoming omniscient, wanders about, on the falling off of the bondage of distractions (or afflictions).",
"51. <b>Sutra:</b> From indifference even thereto, follows Isolation, the seed of evils having been destroyed.<p>When on the decay of trouble and actions, the yogi cogitates thus--'this distinctive cognition is a property of goodness which is among the avoidables, and the Soul is unmodifying and pure, other than Goodness'--then of this disattached yogi, the seeds of trouble becoming unproductive, like the burnt paddy-seed, disappear together with the mind. And those having disappeared, the Soul does not again experience the three-fold pain. Thus the isolation of the Soul consists in his absolute separation from the attributes whose purpose has been fulfilled, and who are manifested in the form of the function of karmic troubles; then alone results the soul's abidance in his own pure--i.e. pure Sentience.",
"52. <b>Sutra:</b> (There should be) avoidance of association with, and pride in, celestial temptations, for there is possibility of recurrence of evils.<p>There are four kinds of yogis:- (1) Prathamakalpika (neophyte of the first stage), (2) the Madhupratika, (3) The Prajnajyoti, and (4) The Atikrantabhavaniya: Of these, the one whose light (of intuition) has begun to operate is the first. The second is the 'truth-supporting-wisdom.' The subduer of the elements and the sense-organs is the third,--one who has taken protective measures towards that which has been felt (the conquest of the senses), and equipped with the means for the accomplishment of that which is to be felt (the vishoka etc.). The fourth is one who has gone beyond feeling; the one purpose of such a one is the retrograde activity (dissolution) of the mind; and to him belongs the sevenfold knowledge of the last stage.<p>To the Brahmana directly perceiving the Madhumati stage, the gods--perceiving the purity of his goodness--invite him to the powers: 'Well! come and enjoy yourselves here! Desirable are these pleasures! And desirable is this girl! This drug stops old age and death Airy is this conveyance! These are the Kalpa-trees! Sacred is the celestial Ganga! Perfect are the great Rishis! Excellent and agreeable are the Apsaras! Supernatural the Eye and the Ear! Adamantine the body! Thou hast acquired a right to all this by thy qualities,--so come and have recourse to this undying undecaying abode, loved of the Gods.'<p>Being thus invited, the yogi is to think over the faults of attachment in this manner: 'Being broiled in the fire of metempsychosis, and passing through the dark abyss of birth and death, I have somehow or other acquired this light of yoga, the dispeller of the darkness of troubles. Of this light the airy objects (of sense) born of desire, are the opponents. So how am l, having acquired this light, to be deceived by a miragic longing for the sensuous objects, and thus make to burn in myself the dying embers of the fire of metempsychosis? So good bye, to you all dreamy sensuous objects, the desired of poor people!' In this determined attitude the yogi is to sit for meditation. Having avoided association, he is also to avoid pride--i.e., (he is not to take pride) in the fact of his being invited even by the gods, because steeped in this pride and considering himself safe, he will not perceive himself caught up by the hair by Death. And then will negligence,--looking for another hole (discrepancy) in his conduct, and only suppressible by constant watchfulness, finding the above loophole,--will enliven the (sleeping) afflictions. Thence the possibility of evils. Thus for one who avoids both association and pride, the end will be strengthened, and the end to be contemplated will come up to the front.",
"53. <b>Sutra:</b> From Samyama over the moments and their order, the knowledge born of discrimination.<p>As the smallest division of matter is the atom, so the smallest division of time is the moment--which is the time taken by the motion of an atom from one place to another; and the uninterrupted flow of this is 'order.' Of moment and its order there is no aggregate; therefore Day, Month etc. are only aggregates of so many cognitions (each coming in one moment). Thus Time is devoid of reality, being a mere creation of the mind; but being correlated to the verbal cognitions, it appears as a distinct entity to ordinary people in the distracted state. The Moment thus becoming objective (i.e., an entity in itself) becomes also related to the (assumed) order; this order consists in the non-interruption of two moments,-- to this (order) the time-knowing yogis give the name 'Time'. Two moments cannot occur together; for no order is possible for any two things occurring simultaneously. Order is the sequence of the following moment from the preceding one. Therefore the present is the only moment, there being none either past or future; and as such there is no collective term for it (as Time). The future and the past moments (those that are popularly so called) are to be explained as referring to the different modifications. Thus by means of a single moment does all the world experience modifications; and all the properties are mere encumbrances on this single moment.<p>By the Samyama over this moment and its order, there is direct perception of these, and thence proceeds the knowledge born of discrimination.",
"54. The object of the knowledge is now described:<p><b>Sutra:</b> Therefrom results the knowledge of the (difference of) two similars, when that difference is not marked out by kind, character or position.<p>Two similar objects resembling each other in position and character, the ground of difference exists in the difference of kind,--as in the case of the cow and the horse. When there is similarity of position and kind, then it exists in that of character--as the Kalakshi cow, and the Swastimati cow. Of two fruits of the same kind and character, the ground of difference lies in the difference of their position--one above and the other below (in a tree). If however at the time of coming across the first, the mind of the agent is absorbed in the other, and as such the first one also is brought over to the place of the second, then the order of position becomes inexplicable by the ordinary process; but it comes from discriminative knowledge free from all doubt. How? The place occupied by the first fruit is different from that occupied by the second fruit; and these two fruits differ by the recognition of their respective positions; and the ground of difference between the two is the recognition of respective positions. By this example it is shown that the yogi recognises the difference between two atoms similar in kind, character and position, by the direct perception of the time and place related to the first atom, the perception of the place of the second atom being due to impossibility of the former place being occupied by the second atom simultaneously with the first.<p>Others on the other hand describe the process thus:--'It is the final specific property that produces the knowledge of difference. But in this case also the ground of difference is the difference in position and character, as also the difference in shape and kind. The difference in time is amenable to the perception of the yogi only.' Hence it has been declared: There is no real difference, in the absence of the differences of shape and kind' says Varshaganya.",
"55. <b>Sutra:</b> The knowledge born of discrimination is emancipative, omni-objective, semper-objective and simultaneous.<p>'Emancipative'--Intuitional or non-experiential (vide. 3.33) 'Omni-objective'--there is nothing that is not perceptible to it.<p>'Semper-objective'--knowing everything in all forms and conditions and at all time, past, present and future.<p>'Simultaneous'--perceiving everything in every way, at the same moment.<p>Such is the knowledge born of discrimination, in its complete form. The light of yoga is a part thereof, so long as it is accomplished by resting on the 'honeyed' stage.", 
"56. To one who has acquired discriminative knowledge or to one who has not there accrues ...<p><b>Sutra:</b> Isolation on the equality of the purity of Goodness and Soul.<p>When Buddhic Goodness being washed clear of all taint of Foulness and Darkness, and having its activity restricted to the recognition of the difference or goodness and the soul, the seed of troubles is burnt up, and then the Buddhi becomes similar to the Soul in purity. The purity of the Soul consists in the absence of imposed experience. Under such circumstances, results Isolation to the perfect as well as to the imperfect,-- to one who has discriminative knowledge, and to one has not. On the attainment of wisdom by one who has burnt up the seeds of trouble there is no need for anything. Perfections born of meditation as well as wisdom, are all included in the said Sattvic purity. As matter of fact however wisdom dispels the want of perception or ignorance, on the suppression whereof the resultant troubles cease to come forth; and the absence of the troubles leads to absence of karmic fruition. In this state, the attributes, having all their functions finished, do not present themselves again to the soul's sight,--and in this lies the Soul's Isolation. In this state the Soul becomes isolated, in the pure effulgence of his own pristine form."

"1. <b>Sutra:</b> The occult powers are produced by birth, herbs, incantations, austerities, or Meditation.<p>The Power due to birth is brought about by corporeal change. 'By herbs:' e.g., the medicinal preparations in the house of the Asuras (i.e. Patala). 'By incantations.' Such as the acquirement of 'Molecularity' (Anima), the capability of approaching the sky. 'By austerities' the accomplishment of desire, e.g., being capable of attaining to any desirable form, the yogi moves about here, there and everywhere, in accordance with his own unimpeded will. The Powers due to Meditation have already been described.",
"2. Of the body and the sense-organs, developed into another kind,--<p><b>Sutra:</b> The transformation into another kind (results) from the transmutation of the material cause. The previous form having been dissolved, the production of the following change is due to a re-arrangement of the constituent particles. The material causes of the body and the sense-organs, in helping their modifications or effects, by means of transmutation, depend upon such instrumental causes as virtue and the rest.",
"3. <b>Sutra:</b> To the material causes, the instrument is non-efficient; from it (proceeds) the piercing of the covering,--as in the case of the husbandsman.<p>The instruments in the shape of virtue etc., are no helps to the mutations of the material causes; for certainly the cause is not urged by the effect. How then? 'From it proceeds the piercing of the covering etc.,' As the husbandsman,-- desiring to irrigate, from a full supply of water in one field, another field in the same plane, or in one lower or higher, does not carry the water by means of his hands, but only cuts through the bunds, on the opening of which the water of itself flows through the adjoining field;-- so in the same manner, virtue pierces the covering of the material censes, in the shape of vice, on the removal whereof, the material causes of their own accord, supply their various modifications. Or again, as the husbandsman in the same field is not capable of supplying either liquid or solid ingredients to the root of the paddy; what he does is to remove from the field all foreign weeds and plants, on the removal whereof the ingredients of themselves enter into the paddy-roots; so in the same manner, virtue is only the cause of the suppression of vice--purity and impurity being diametrically opposed to each other--and it is no cause in the operation of the material cause. In this connection Nandiswara and others, should be quoted as examples. On the other hand vice also only tends to suppress virtue; and then follows the change into impurity--e.g. Nahusha changed into an Ajagara serpent and the like.",
"4. When the yogi creates (for himself) many bodies, then, have all of these one and the same mind, or has each of these a separate mind? Reply:<p><b>Sutra:</b> The created internal organs proceed from Self-consciousness alone.<p>The yogi produces the created internal organ with the help only of Self-consciousness, the cause of internal organs. Consequently each body has a (separate) internal organ.",
"5. <b>Sutra:</b> In the diverse tendency of the many, the impelling internal organ is one.<p>'How should the action of many internal organs follow the tendency of the one internal organ?'--(thinking thus, the yogi) makes one internal organ such as urges the others to action. Thence follows the diversity of action.", 
"6. <b>Sutra:</b> Thereof the contemplation-born is without impressions or residua.<p>The created internal organs are of five kinds, the occult powers being due to (1) birth, (2) herbs, (3)incantations, (4) austerities and (5) meditation. Of these, the internal organ which is brought about by contemplation, is without residua,--that is to say, it is free from all tendency to attachment and the like; and for this reason it has no connection with virtue and vice; because the yogi has had all his troubles ended; for others (besides the yogi), there is accumulation of karmic impressions.",
"7. <b>Sutra:</b> The actions of the Yogi are neither white nor black; those of others are of three kinds.<p>The classes of actions are fourfold--(1)the black, (2) the white-black, (3) the white,--and (4) the non-white-non-black. Of these the black kind belongs to the evil-minded. The white-black, is performable by external means; and in connection with this, the accumulation of karmic residua is due to the infliction of pain and doing of kindness to others; the white one belongs to those given to penance, study and contemplation; this kind, being confined solely to the internal organ, cannot be performed by external means, and as such, is not due to the infliction of pain on others. The 'Non-white-non-black' belongs to the Sanyasis, whose troubles are at an end and who are equipped with the final or highest body only. Of these, to the Yogi belongs the non-white because he has renounced all desire for fruition--, and the non-black--because of non-acceptance. Those of other beings, are of the former three kinds.",
"8. <b>Sutra:</b> Thence is the manifestation of the impressions or residua which are suitable to its fruition.<p>'Thence' i.e., from the threefold action 'which are suitable to its fruition'--i.e., suitable to the particular fruition of actions of particular kinds; that is to say, those residua that help the fruition of the action,--of these alone there is the manifestation. For a celestial or godly action, in its functions, can never lead to the manifestation of the infernal, the brutal or the human residua; on the contrary, what is manifested or enlivened (thereby) is only the residua that are conformable to celestial existence. The same consideration holds respecting the hellish, the bestial and the human (actions).",
"9. <b>Sutra:</b> On account of the uniformity of memory and impressions (residua), there is sequence or uninterruptibility of relation, even after breaks by class, locality and time.<p>The beginning of the fruition of the action leading to the feline birth, is always enlivened or manifested by the particular manifesting cause which leads to its manifestation; and as such, if this fruition,--even though removed or interrupted either by hundreds of species or by great distance, or by hundreds of cycles,--again happens to become manifested only through its own special manifested causes; then it becomes vivid by taking hold of the residua brought about by the previous experience of feline birth. Why? Because, of these (residua), the only manifesting cause is an analogous action, even though they may be removed therefrom; and in this manner there is an uninterruptibility or continuity of relation (between the residua and its analogous manifesting action). Why? Because 'of the uniformity of memory and the impressions'. (That is to say)--As the experiences, so the impressions; and these latter are exactly similar to the Karmic residua; and lastly as the residua, so the memory (or Instinct). Thus we see that memory or instinct is due to impressions removed therefrom by class, locality and time. This memory again produces impressions. Thus these impressions due to memory are manifested by the force of the attainment of the function of Karmic residua. Consequently, even of the interrupted (actions and fruition) the sequence is established, on account of the uninterruptibility of the causal relation.",
"10. <b>Sutra:</b> Besides there is no beginning about them, because of the eternity of desire.<p>Of these residua there is no beginning, because of the eternity of desire. The selfish desire--'may I not cease to exist,' 'may I live'--met with in every individual, cannot be said to be natural (product, and as such not eternal). Why? (Because), How else, would there be,--for the newly born infant who has not yet experienced death--any fear of death, which is due only to aversion and pain? For certainly a natural object does not admit of a cause (instrumental cause). The fact therefore is, that the internal organ chained to eternal residua, through certain causes, gets hold of some of the residua, and then comes forward for the experience of the spirit.<p>Other theorists have asserted that the internal organ is expansive and contractible, like the jar-and-mansion lamp; and as such, it is of the same form as that of the body; and thus would be explained its existence in this interim, as also its rebirth. The Masters however lay down that, what is expansive and contractible is only the function of the internal organ, which of itself is omnipresent. This (internal organ) again is dependent on causes such as virtue and the like. The cause again is of two kinds--external and internal; the former is such as is to bodily means--e.g., hymn-singing, charity and reverence; the latter depending on the internal organ alone,--e.g., faith and the like. As is 'The pastimes of the Yogi, friendship and the like, are naturally independent of external means, and (as such) bring about the highest virtue'. Of these two causes, the mental is the stronger. Why? Because, what can supersede wisdom and dispassion? who can render the Dandaka forest bare by bodily action, without mental strength? and who can drink up the ocean, like Agastya?", 
"11. <b>Sutra:</b> Being held together by cause, effect, substratum and support, the absence of these would produce their absence.<p>'Cause'--From virtue results pleasure, and from vice pain; from pleasure proceeds attachment and from pain aversion; thence follows endeavour; and the agent acting through this endeavour, by mind, words and body, tends to favour one individual and hurt the other; thence follow virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, attachment and aversion, --this operation constitutes the wheel of metempsychosis; of this ever-turning wheel, the guiding force is Ignorance; the root of all troubles. Such is the 'cause.'<p>'The effect' is that on which is based the existence of virtue and the rest; (for) there is no production of that which never before existed. The mind, equipped with its faculties, is the 'substratum' of the residua; as when the faculties of the mind have been destroyed, the residuum cannot continue to exist, for want of a substratum.<p>That with a view to which an object enlivens a particular residuum is the 'support' of such a residuum.<p>Thus, all residua, being held together by these--cause, effect, substratum and support--, when these latter cease to exist, there follows the absence of the residua based upon them.",
"12. (Objection):- There is no production for a non-entity; nor is there any destruction of an entity; under the circumstances, how would the residua, being entities, be undone?--(Reply)--<p><b>Sutra:</b> Past and Future exist in real nature, in consequence of the difference in the conditions of the properties.<p>That which is to be is the 'future', and that which has been is the 'past', and that which is fulfilling its function is the 'present'. These three are cognisable by (Yogic) cognition. If these did not exist in reality, then there would be no cognition, without an object. Therefore the past and the future do exist in reality. And further, if the agency bringing about the effects of actions--partaking either of enjoyment or of Isolation--were a nonentity, then the endeavour of experts with a view to--i.e., by means of--that (agency) would be inexplicable. The cause is capable only of exhibiting to the present time the already existing effect (lying latent), and not of bringing forth an altogether new entity. A perfectly established cause only helps the effect in a particular way, but does not produce anything new.<p>An object is always endowed with a number of properties; and such properties exist in accordance with different conditions. And though the present, being related to a certain individual, exists materially, yet the same cannot be said with regard to the past and the future. How then? The future exists in its manifestible (that which to be manifested) form; as the past exists in the individual that has been. The manifestation of form is only possible for the conditions of the present; and it is not possible for those of the past or of the future. And during the existence of our condition, it is quite compatible that the other two conditions should exist in close relationship with the (same) object; hence the existence of three conditions is not preceded by their non-existence.", 
"13. <b>Sutra:</b> They are individualised (manifested) or subtile And consist in attributes.<p>The aforesaid properties, having the three conditions, consist in the individualised,--i.e., in the present-- and in the subtile--i.e., the past and future, these latter forming the six non-specific elements. All these however are particular formations of the Attributes, and hence, in reality, are of the nature of these Attributes. As says the authoritative injunction: 'The highest of the Attributes does not come within the range of vision; what does come within visual range is altogether insignificant, like (Maya).'",
"14. If all objects are the Attributes, how do you explain (the singular use, such as) 'one word,' 'one sense'? Reply:<p><b>Sutra:</b> From unity of modification (results) the one-ness of a thing.<p>Of the Attributes,-- capable of illumination, activity and inertness--and of the nature of the means of perception (grahana),--there is one modification though the form of a sense-organ, constituting the ear, a sense-organ and of (the same attributes) being of the nature of the object of perception there is another modification through the form of sound, making sound the object; of sound and the rest, resembling each other in form, there is one modification, the earth-atom, for its components the rudimentary elements; and of these (sound etc.) again, there is another modification,-- the earth, the cow, the tree, the mountain and the like; similarly among the other elements, there can only a be single common modification, based on their respective properties, viscidity, heat, elasticity (pranamitva) and spaciousness (avakasadana).<p>'There is no object which is not accompanies by an idea; on the other hand, we have ideas not accompanies by any object such as those occurring in a dream'--The Nihilists who in this manner set aside the reality of the form of the object asserting, as they do, that 'the object is only the creation of an idea. like objects of a dream, and it does not exist in reality';--how can these persons be believed who despise and abandon the reality of the object, on the strength of the untruthful knowledge of vikalpa,...the object which has by means of its inherent capability presented itself before him in its real form?",
"15. Wherefore is this improper? Reply:<p><b>Sutra:</b> Notwithstanding the sameness of the object, the course of the two are distinct, from diversity of the internal organ.<p>A single object, occupying many internal organs, is (said to be) 'common'; and this (object) is not due to the agency of a single internal organ (or mind), nor to that of many minds; it exists by itself. How? Because of the diversity of minds, notwithstanding the sameness of the object. That is to say, even on the sameness of the object, the mind has the idea of pleasure, through virtue, and also the idea of pain from the same object, through vice; from the same the idea of delusion, through ignorance; and lastly from that very object, the idea of indifference through right vision. Under such circumstances, to whose mind can such an object owe its existence ? Certainly it is not likely that the object created by one mind should affect another mind. Consequently of the object and the idea (or cognition),--distinct from each other on account of their respective characters of the cognisable and the cogniser.--the course is distinct; and there is not the slightest tinge of any confusion among these.<p>According to the Sankhya view again, the object is endowed with the three Attributes; and the function of the Attributes is mobile; hence the object is related to the minds through the instrumentality of virtue and the rest, and through its different forms, the cause of the different cognitions, appearing in accordance with the aforesaid instruments.",
"16. Some people have thus declared: 'The object is coexistent with cognition, because it is cognisable, like pleasure and the like'--These people by this means set aside the commonality (of object and cognition, mentioned above), and thus deprive the object of its character, at all times, past as well as present.<p>(To these subjective Idealists it is replied.)-- <b>Sutra:</b> Nor is the object dependent upon a single mind;--(because) what would it be when not cognised by that?<p>If the object depended upon a single mind, then, if that mind were either confounded or suppressed, then the form of the object would not be apprehended thereby; nor would it be amenable to any other mind (being dependent upon the former alone); and as such it would become 'uncognised' (apramaanaka); i.e., its character would not be comprehended by any one; under such circumstances, what would the object be? Then again, being connected with the mind, whence would it be produced? Those parts of the object which were not present (before the particular mind) would cease to be; similarly the non-perception of the back (of a certain animal) would lead to the non-cognition of the stomach as well. For these reasons, the object must be independent, common to all perceiving agents. Minds too are independent and act differently with regard to each person. From the connection of these two (object and mind) results cognition (or perception), which constitute the experience of the person.",
"17. <b>Sutra:</b> A thing is known or unknown, consequence of the necessity of the mind being tinged by it.<p>The object, of the nature of a magnet, connects with itself and tinges the mind, which is of the nature of soft iron. The object whereby the mind is tinged, is known; and all objects besides this are unknown? Thus on account of the object being known and unknown, the mind is modifiable.",
"18. He to whom such a mind itself is an object, to such a one--<p><b>Sutra:</b> The functions of the mind are always known, for its presiding spirit is unmodifiable.<p>lf like the mind, the spirit also were liable to mutation then would its objects also, in the shape of the functions or the mind, be known and unknown, like sound and other objects. But the constant consciousness and perceptibility of the mind leads to the inference of the immutable (or constant) character of its presiding spirit.",
"19. The following question may arise--The mind itself may be illuminative of itself as well of the objects, like fire; against this it is declared--<p><b>Sutra:</b> It is not self-illuminative, since it is perceptible.<p>As the other senses, as well as sound and other objects, being perceptible, are not self-illuminative, so should also the mind be understood to be. Nor can fire be an instance here; because the fire does not illuminate its non-illuminated form. Moreover illumination is seen to follow the connection of the illuminated and the illuminator; but such connection is not possible with regard to one's own form. And again, the assertion that 'the mind is self-illuminating' literally means that it is not cognisable by any person.--e.g., Space (Akasa) existing in its own nature, can never exist in any other object. But the actions of all living beings are seen to follow from the consciousness of the activities of their mind--e.g., 'I am angry,' 'I am afraid,' 'in this is my attachment, and to this my aversion,'--such consciousness would not be explicable, if the mind were not perceptible.",
"20. <b>Sutra:</b> Two (objects) cannot be cognised at one and the same time.<p>At one and the same time, it is not possible to cognise one's own form as well as that of others. The Nihilists hold that the action, effect and cause (origin, action and instrument) are all identical.",
"21. It may be held that the mind suppressed by its own nature is cognised by another mind, following close upon it. (Reply)<p><b>Sutra:</b> (If) cognition by another mind (be postulated),-- there would be an infinity of cognitions and also an admixture (or confusion) of memory.<p>If the mind were perceived by another mind, then whereby would the cognition of that cognition be perceived? If by another cognition, and this last too by a fourth and so on, then we would be landed on a regressus ad infinitum,--and there would also arise a confusion of memory; for, so many as there are perceptions of cognitions to cognitions, as many would be the (corresponding) memories. And from this admixture would result the non-ascertainment (i.e., uncertainty) one any one memory. Thus (we find that) the Nihilists have confounded everything, by denying spirit as the (one) cogniser of (all) cognitions. These Nihilists again assuming cogniser-ship at random, cease to be logical. Some of them assume a mere entity, and hold that there is a certain entity which discards the present five skandhas or 'bodies' and takes to other skandhas; and having asserted this much, they fight shy of the same (entity): Thus 'for the sake of the dispassion of the form of great disgust for the skandhas, and for that of the non-production or suppression thereof, I will lead the continent life under a preceptor'--having said this, they again turn to suppress the very existence of the entity. The Sankhya, Yoga and the other systems declare that word 'swa', denotes the lord of the mind, the spirit, the cogniser.", 
"22. How?<p><b>Sutra:</b> The non-transitional spirit (obtains) the consciousness of its own cognition, when it takes its form.<p>The sentient faculty, unmodifying and unchanging, being reflected in the modifiable (the mind), falls in with its functions; and the function or the cognition (or understanding) is said to be identical with that of the internal organ (mind), on accounts of its (the reflected sentient faculty) merely imitating the function of the mind which has attained the form of the superimposition of the sentient faculty. As is declared: 'Neither the nether world, nor mountain caves nor darkness, nor the crevices of the ocean,--(none of these,) is the cave where the eternal Brahma is concealed; the wise call it the function of the mind, pure and simple.",
"23. It is for this reason that it is held (that)--<p><b>Sutra:</b> The mind tinged by the seer and the seen, is (able to perceive) all objects.<p>The mind is tinged by she cognisable object, and being itself an object, is conjoined by the subjective (knowing) soul to its functions; thus does the mind become 'tinged by the seer and the seen';--i.e., enlivened by the object and the subject, and fallen in with the forms of the sentient and the insentient,--and appearing non-objective though really objective, and sentient though really insentient,--'resembling the rock crystal,'--said (to be able to perceive) all objects. It is for this reason that certain people being led away by this similarity of the mind, have declared it as alone sentient, Others again hold that all this is mere mind; any other object, cow or pot etc., together with its cause does not exist. All these (theorists) deserve to be pitied. Why? Because for their mistake, there is a ground in the shape of the mind enlivened by every kind of form. Consequently in meditative consciousness the object cognised being a reflection, is distinct from it (the mind), because of its (the mind) being its substratum. If this object were only the mind, then how would the form of consciousness be ascertained by consciousness itself? For these reasons, it is the Spirit by whom is determined or ascertained, in consciousness, the reflected object. Thus then those alone are the right thinkers who differentiate the cogniser, the cognition and the cognised in their respective characters,--(basing the differentiation) on the difference in the mind as enlivened by each of them severally.",
"24. Wherefore is this? (Reply:)<p><b>Sutra:</b> Though variegated by innumerable impressions, it exists for another, because it operates by association.<p>The mind though variegated by innumerable impressions, yet exists for another's purpose,--that is to say, for the experience (or enjoyment) and liberation of others, not for its own purpose, because it operates by association, like a house. The mind, operating as it does by association, can never exist for itself. For certainly, a mind operating for pleasure is not for its own pleasure; nor is wisdom for its own wisdom; on the other hand, both of these are for another's purpose. This 'another' is the soul with a purpose--the purpose being experience and liberation, and not any and everything other than mind. If the Nihilist were to bring forward any object at random (as being the 'other' for whose sake the mind operates), all such objects would be found to be operating by association and as such, existing for the sake of something else. The particular 'another,' the soul, just spoken of does not operate by association.",
"25. <b>Sutra:</b> For the knower of the difference, (there is) cessation of all thought of the nature of self.<p>As in the rainy season, from the sprouting forth of grass is inferred the existence of the seed, so in the same manner, when we find a certain person horripilating (Editor: getting goose-bumps) and shedding tears of inward pleasure, we infer the existence of its seed in the shape of some peculiar deed, partaking of the nature of Bliss, done in the past (and now bearing its fruit). For such a one the natural hankering after the nature of self is (continually) operating. The absence of such deeds leads to what is thus declared: having renounced his own nature, by reason of some deficiency, there arises a liking for the sceptic view and aversion to the standard doctrine; during this state is a hankering after the nature of self, in this form: Who was I ? How was l? What is this? How is this? Who shall I be? How shall I be? This hankering ceases for one who attains discrimination. Why? Because this is a curious modification of the mind; the soul however, in the absence of Ignorance, is pure, untainted by the properties of the mind. Therefore, for such an expert the hankering after the nature of self ceases.",
"26. <b>Sutra:</b> Then the mind is turned towards discrimination, and is bowed down by Isolation. The mind, that was bowed down by objects and bent towards ignorance, now becomes otherwise--i.e., bowed down by isolation and bent towards discriminative knowledge.", 
"27. <b>Sutra:</b> In the intervals thereof, there are other cognitions, due to impressions.<p>In the intervals of the mind, being bent towards the discrimination of itself, flowing in the current of the discrimination of matter and spirit, there are other cognitions such as, 'I exist,' 'This is mine,' 'I know' or 'I do not know.' Whence? From the fading seeds, the foregone impressions.",
"28. <b>Sutra:</b> The destruction of these should be as already described in the case of the distractions.<p>As the distractions, on the destruction of their sprouting faculty, cease to be capable of sprouting up, so in the same manner, the foregone impression having its sprouting faculty burnt up by the fire of wisdom, ceases to give birth to consciousness (or cognition). The impressions due to wisdom however depend upon the destruction of the operative capacity of the mind; and therefore these are not considered here.",
"29. <b>Sutra:</b> To the disinterested in even illumination or discriminative knowledge (accrues) exclusive discriminative wisdom leading to the meditation called the 'Cloud of Virtue.'<p>When such a Brahmana loses all interest in illumination even--i.e., who desires nothing even from that, and becomes indifferent to it,--to him accrues exclusive discriminative wisdom; and thus the seed of metempsychosis being destroyed, no more cognitions are produced; and thus proceeds the meditation called the 'Cloud of Virtue.'",
"30. <b>Sutra:</b> Thence the cessation of distractions and actions.<p>On the attainment thereof, the distractions, Ignorance and the rest, are destroyed from their very roots, the good and bad actions also are put a stop to; and on the cessation of distractions and actions, the wise one becomes liberated, while living. Wherefore? Because misconception is the sole cause of worldliness. For certainly no one has ever witnessed the birth of one whose misconception has been removed.",
"31. <b>Sutra:</b> Then in consequence of the infiniteness of the knowledge free from all coverings and impurities, the knowable becomes small.<p>The infinity of knowledge results from its being free from the obscurations of action and distraction. The faculty of knowledge, suppressed under the obscuring Tamas, is only occasionally uncovered and rendered operative by (Rajas) and then becomes capable of cognising. Under the circumstances, when it becomes clear of all impurities and obscurations, then results its infiniteness. And from the infiniteness of knowledge, the knowable becomes small--like the firefly in the sky. In this connection it is declared: 'The blind man pierced the gems, the fingerless one joined them together, the neckless one wore it, and the tongueless one praised it.'",
"32. <b>Sutra:</b> Thereupon follows the termination of the succession of the modifications of the Attributes, which have accomplished their end.<p>On the appearance of the Cloud of Virtue, end the successive modifications of the Attributes whose ends have been fulfilled. Because (Attributes), that have fulfilled experience and liberation, and whose succession has ended, dare not tarry a moment longer.",
"33. What is this succession? (Reply:)<p><b>Sutra:</b> The succession is the counterpart of the moment perceptible at the end of the modification.<p>The succession, consisting in the intervals of moments, is perceived by the end of the modification. For the oldness of a new piece of cloth, at its end (destruction), does not follow without the consciousness of the successive moment (of its duration). This succession is seen to exist even with regard to eternal objects. The eternality is two-fold--the unchanging eternality, and the modifying eternality. Of these the unchanging eternality belongs to the Soul and the modifying eternality to the Attributes. That object is eternal the modifications whereof do not destroy its real form. And the forms of both Soul and the Attributes are not destroyed, therefore both of them are eternal. With regard to the products of the Attributes--Buddhi and the rest--the succession, perceptible at the end of the modification, has its own end perceptible; whereas it has not its end perceptible in the case of the eternal objects; the Attributes themselves with regard to the unchanging eternal, the liberated souls, existing in their own form, the existence of the form is perceived in succession; and here too, the succession, having its end non-perceptible, is assumed through the action of existence,--the assumption being based up on 'word.'<p>Question:--'Of this Universe, existing in the Attributes by its existence and progress, is there an end to the succession or not?' Reply:--This indeed is unanswerable! Why? The question admitting of an absolute reply is such as 'Will all that is born, die?' (The reply is): 'Oh! Yes.' On the other hand, there is another question (not admitting of an absolute reply) such as 'will every object that dies be born?' The answer to this question must be a qualified one viz., the wise one whose desires have been destroyed and who has attained discrimination, will not be born; others besides such a one, will be surely born. Similarly on being asked, 'Is the human species the highest or not?' the reply must be given in a qualified form: The human species is higher than the other animals, whereas it is not so in comparison with the Gods and the Rishis. The question 'Has the universe an end or not?' is unanswerable directly; because (the reply must be:) 'for the wise one (above mentioned), there is an end to the continuance of the universe,--not for any other.' For this reason, if the reply were based on any one the two, i.e., if the reply were given directly--yes or no--without qualification, there would be a mistake. Hence the aforesaid question must be broken up (before being answered.)",
"34. It has been declared that Isolation follows at the end of the succession of the capacity of the Attributes. This Isolation is now described:<p><b>Sutra:</b> The repression of the Attributes, devoid of the soul's purpose, is the Isolation; or it is the sentient faculty abiding in itself.<p>The repression (or inverse resolution) of the Attributes of the nature of cause and effect, that have fulfilled experience and isolation, and are (hence) unable to serve any further purpose of the soul, is Isolation. The sentient faculty of the soul abiding in itself, i.e., disconnected from the attributes of Buddhi, is pure; and (such a sentient faculty) continuing forever in that condition, constitutes Isolation."

"1. Now the exposition of Yoga is being made.",
"2. The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga.",
"3. Then the Seer [Self] abides in His own nature.",
"4. At other times [the Self appears to] assume the forms of the mental modifications.",
"5. There are five kinds of mental modifications which are either painful or painless.",
"6. They are right knowledge, misconception, verbal delusion, sleep and memory.",
"7. The sources of right knowledge are direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony.",
"8. Misconception occurs when knowledge of something is not based upon its true form.",
"9. An image that arises on hearing mere words without any reality [as its basis] is verbal delusion.",
"10. That mental modification supported by cognition of nothingness is sleep.",
"11. When a mental modification of an object previously experienced and not forgotten comes back to consciousness, that is memory.",
"12. These mental modifications are restrained by practice and non-attachment.",
"13. Of these two, effort toward steadiness of mind is practice.",
"14. Practice becomes firmly grounded when well attended to for a long time, without break and in all earnestness.",
"15. The consciousness of self-mastery in one who is free from craving of objects seen or heard about is non-attachment.",
"16. When there is non-thirst for even the gunas (constituents of Nature) due to realization of the Purusha (true Self), that is supreme non-attachment.",
"17. Samprajnata samadhi (distinguished contemplation) is accompanied by reasoning, reflecting, rejoicing and pure I-am-ness.",
"18. By the firmly convinced practice of the complete cessation of the mental modifications, the impressions only remain. This is the other samadhi [asamprajnata nor non-distinguished].",
"19. Those who merely leave their physical bodies and attain the state of celestial deities, or those who get merged in Nature, have rebirth.",
"20. To the others, this asamprajnata samadhi could come through faith, strength, memory, contemplation or by discernment.",
"21. To the keen and intent practitioner this [samadhi] comes very quickly.",
"22. The time necessary for success further depends on whether the practice is mild, medium or intense.",
"23. Or [samadhi is attained] by devotion with total dedication to God [Isvara].",
"24. Isvara is the supreme Purusha, unaffected by any afflictions, actions, fruits of actions or by any inner impressions or desires.",
"25. In Him is the complete manifestation of the seed of omniscience.",
"26. Unconditioned by time, He is the teacher of even the most ancient teachers.",
"27. The word expressive of Isvara is the mystic sound OM. [Note: OM is God's name as well as form.]",
"28. To repeat it with reflection upon its meaning is an aid.",
"29. From this practice all the obstacles disappear and simultaneously dawns knowledge of the inner Self.",
"30. Disease, dullness, doubt, carelessness, laziness, sensuality, false perception, failure to reach firm ground and slipping from the ground gained -- these distractions of the mind-stuff are the obstacles.",
"31. Accompaniments to the mental distractions include distress, despair, trembling of the body, and disturbed breathing.",
"32. The practice of concentration on a single subject [or the use of one technique] is the best way to prevent the obstacles and their accompaniments.",
"33. By cultivating attitudes of friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and disregard toward the wicked, the mind-stuff retains its undisturbed calmness.",
"34. Or that calm is retained by the controlled exhalation or retention of the breath.",
"35. Or the concentration on subtle sense perceptions can cause steadiness of mind.",
"36. Or by concentrating on the supreme, ever-blissful Light within.",
"37. Or by concentrating on a great soul's mind which is totally freed from attachment to sense objects.",
"38. Or by concentrating on an experience had during dream or deep sleep.",
"39. Or by meditating on anything one chooses that is elevating.",
"40. Gradually, one's mastery in concentration extends from the primal atom to the greatest magnitude.",
"41. Just as the naturally pure crystal assumes shapes and colors of objects placed near it, so the Yogi's mind, with its totally weakened modifications, becomes clear and balanced and attains the state devoid of differentiation between knower, knowable and knowledge. This culmination of meditation is samadhi.",
"42. The samadhi in which name, form and knowledge of them is mixed is called savitarka samadhi, or samadhi with deliberation.",
"43. When the memory is well purified, the knowledge of the object of concentration shines alone, devoid of the distinction of name and quality. This is nirvitarka samadhi, or samadhi without deliberation.",
"44. In the same way, savichara (reflective) and nirvichara (super or non-reflective) samadhis, which are practiced upon subtle objects, are explained.",
"45. The subtlety of possible objects of concentration ends only at the undefinable.",
"46. All these samadhis are sabija (with seed), which could bring one back into bondage or mental disturbance.",
"47. In the purity of nirvichara samadhi, the supreme Self shines.",
"48. This is ritambhara prajna, or the absolute true consciousness.",
"49. This special truth is totally different from knowledge gained by hearing, study of scripture or inference.",
"50. The impression produced by this samadhi wipes out all other impressions.",
"51. When even this impression is wiped out, every impression is totally wiped out and there is nirbija [seedless] samadhi.",
],[
"1. Accepting pain as help for purification, study of spiritual books, and surrender to the Supreme Being constitute Yoga in practice.",
"2. They help us minimize obstacles and attain samadhi.",
"3. Ignorance, egoism, attachment, hatred, and clinging to bodily life are the five obstacles.",
"4. Ignorance is the field for the others mentioned after it, whether they be dormant, feeble, intercepted, or sustained.",
"5. Ignorance is regarding the impermanence as permanent, the impure as pure, the painful as pleasant, and the non-Self as the Self.",
"6. Egoism is the identification, as it were, of the power of the Seer (Purusha) with that of the instrument of seeing [body-mind].",
"7. Attachment is that which follows identification with pleasurable experiences.",
"8. Aversion is that which follows identification with painful experiences.",
"9. Clinging to life, flowing by its own potency [due to past experience], exists even in the wise.",
"10. In subtle form, these obstacles can be destroyed by resolving them back into their primal cause [the ego].",
"11. In the active state, they can be destroyed by meditation.",
"12. The womb of karmas (actions and reactions) has its root in these obstacles, and the karmas bring experiences in the seen [present] or in the unseen [future] births.",
"13. With the existence of the root, there will be fruits also: namely, the births of different species of life, their life spans and experiences.",
"14. The karmas bear fruits of pleasure and pain caused by merits and demerit.",
"15. To one of discrimination, everything is painful indeed, due to its consequences: the anxiety and fear over losing what is gained; the resulting impressions left in the mind to create renewed cravings; and the constant conflict among the three gunas, which control the mind.",
"16. Pain that has not yet come is avoidable.",
"17. The cause of that avoidable pain is the union of the Seer (Purusha) and the seen (Prakriti, or Nature).",
"18. The seen is of the nature of the gunas: illumination, activity and inertia; and consists of the elements and sense organs, whose purpose is to provide both experiences and liberation to the Purusha.",
"19. The stages of the gunas are specific, non-specific, defined and undefinable.",
"20. The Seer is nothing but the power of seeing which, although pure, appears to see through the mind.",
"21. The seen exists only for the sake of the Seer.",
"22. Although destroyed for him who has attained liberation, it [the seen] still exists for others, being common to them.",
"23. The union of Owner (Purusha) and owned (Prakriti) causes the recognition of the nature and powers of them both.",
"24. The cause of this union is ignorance.",
"25. Without this ignorance, no such union occurs. This is the independence of the Seer.",
"26. Uninterrupted discriminative discernment is the method for its removal.",
"27. One's wisdom in the final stage is sevenfold. [One experiences the end of 1) desire to know anything more; 2) desire to stay away from any thing; 3) desire to gain anything new; 4) desire to do anything; 5) sorrow; 6) fear; 7) delusion.]",
"28. By the practice of the limbs of Yoga, the impurities dwindle away and there dawns the light of wisdom, leading to discriminative discernment",
"29. The eight limbs of Yoga are: 1) yama (abstinence) 2) niyama (observance) 3) asana (posture) 4) pranayama (breath control) 5) pratyahara (sense withdrawal) 6) dharana (concentration) 7) dhyana (meditation) 8) samadhi (contemplation, absorption or superconscious state)",
"30 Yama consists of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-greed.",
"31. These Great Vows are universal, not limited by class, place, time or circumstance.",
"32. Niyama consists of purity, contentment, acceptance but not causing pain, study of spiritual books and worship of God [self-surrender].",
"33. When disturbed by negative thoughts, opposite [positive] ones should be thought of. THis is pratipaksha bhavana.",
"34. When negative thoughts or acts such as violence, etc. are caused to be done or even approved of, whether incited by greed, anger or infatuation, whether indulged in with mild, medium or extreme intensity, they are based on ignorance and bring certain pain. Reflecting thus is also pratipaksha bhavanam.",
"35. In the presence of one firmly established in non-violence, all hostilities cease.",
"36. To one established in truthfulness, actions and their results become subservient.",
"37. To one established in non-stealing, all wealth comes.",
"38. By one established in continence, vigor is gained.",
"39. When non-greed is confirmed, a thorough illumination of the how and why of one's birth comes.",
"40. By purification arises disgust for one's own body and for contact with other bodies.",
"41. Moreover, one gains purity of sattva, cheerfulness of mind, one-pointedness, mastery over the senses, and fitness for Self-realization.",
"42. By contentment, supreme joy is gained.",
"43. By austerity, impurities of body and senses are destroyed and occult powers gained.",
"44. By study of spiritual books comes communion with one's chosen deity.",
"45. By total surrender to God, samadhi is attained.",
"46. Asana is a steady, comfortable posture.",
"47. By lessening the natural tendency for restlessness and by meditating on the infinite, posture is mastered.",
"48. Thereafter, one is undisturbed by the dualities.",
"49. That [firm posture] being acquired, the movements of inhalation and exhalation should be controlled. This is pranayama.",
"50. The modifications of the life-breath are either external, internal or stationary. They are to be regulated by space, time and number and are either long or short.",
"51. There is a fourth kind of pranayama that occurs during concentration on an internal or external object.",
"52. As its result, the veil over the inner Light is destroyed.",
"53. And the mind becomes fit for concentration.",
"54. When the senses withdraw themselves from the objects and imitate, as it were, the nature of the mind-stuff, this is pratyahara.",
"55. Then follows supreme mastery over the senses.",
],[
"1. Dharana is the binding of the mind to one place, object or idea.",
"2. Dhyana is the continuous flow of cognition toward that object.",
"3. Samadhi is the same meditation when there is the shining of the object alone, as if devoid of form.",
"4. The practice of these three [dharana, dhyana and samadhi] upon one object is called samyama.",
"5. By the mastery of samyama comes the light of knowledge.",
"6. Its practice is to be accomplished in stages.",
"7. These three [dharana, dhyana and samadhi] are more internal than the preceding five limbs.",
"8. Even these three are external to the seedless samadhi.",
"9. The impressions which normally arise are made to disappear by the appearance of suppressive efforts, which in turn create new mental modifications. The moment of conjunction of mind and new modifications is nirodha parinama.",
"10. The flow of nirodha parinama becomes steady through habit.",
"11. When there is a decline in distractedness and appearance of one-pointedness, then comes samadhi parinamah (development in samadhi).",
"12. Then again, when the subsiding past and rising present images are identical, there is ekagrata parinama (one-pointedness).",
"13. By this [what has been said in the preceding three Sutras], the transformations of the visible characteristics, time factors and conditions of elements and senses are also described.",
"14. It is the substratum (Prakriti) that by nature goes through latent, uprising and unmanifested phases.",
"15. The succession of these different phases is the cause of the differences in stages of evolution.",
"16. By practicing samyama on the three stages of evolution comes knowledge of past and future.",
"17. A word, its meaning,and the idea behind it are normally confused because of superimposition upon one another. By samyama on the word [or sound] produced by any being, knowledge of its meaning is obtained.",
"18. By direct perception, through samyama, of one's mental impressions, knowledge of past births is obtained.",
"19. By samyama on the distinguishing signs of others' bodies, knowledge of their mental images is obtained.",
"20. But this does not include the support in the person's mind [such as the motive behind the thought, etc.], as that is not the object of the samyama.",
"21. By samyama on the form of one's body, [and by] checking the power of perception by intercepting light from the eyes of the observer, the body becomes invisible.",
"22. In the same way, the disappearance of sound [touch, taste, smell, etc.] is explained.",
"23. Karmas are of two kinds: quickly manifesting and slowly manifesting. By samyama on them, or on the portents of death, the knowledge of the time of death is obtained.",
"24. By samyama on friendliness and other such qualities, the power to transmit them is obtained.",
"25. By samyama on the strength of elephants and other such animals, their strength is obtained.",
"26. By samyama on the Light within, the knowledge of the subtle, hidden and remote is obtained. [Note: subtle as atoms, hidden as treasure, remote as far distant lands.]",
"27. By samyama on the sun, knowledge of the entire solar system is obtained.",
"28. By samyama on the moon comes knowledge of the stars' alignment.",
"29. By samyama on the pole star comes knowledge of the stars' movements.",
"30. By samyama on the navel plexus, knowledge of the body's constitution is obtained.",
"31. By samyama on the pit of the throat, cessation of hunger and thirst is achieved.",
"32. By samyama on the kurma nadi (a subtle tortoise-shaped tube located below the throat), motionlessness in the meditative posture is achieved.",
"33. By samyama on the light at the crown of the head (sahasrara chakra), visions of masters and adepts are obtained.",
"34. Or, in the knowledge that dawns by spontaneous enlightenment [through a life of purity], all the powers come by themselves.",
"35. By samyama on the heart, the knowledge of the mind-stuff is obtained.",
"36. The intellect and the Purusha (or Atman) are totally different, the intellect existing for the sake of the Purusha, while the Purusha exists for its own sake. Not distinguishing this is the cause of all experiences; and by samyama on the distinction, knowledge of the Purusha is gained.",
"37. From this knowledge arises superphysical hearing, touching, seeing, tasting and smelling through spontaneous intuition.",
"38. These [superphysical senses] are obstacles to [nirbija] samadhi but are siddhis (powers or accomplishments) in the worldly pursuits.",
"39. By the loosening of the cause [of the bondage of mind to body] and by knowledge of the procedure of the mind-stuff's functioning, entering another's body is accomplished.",
"40. By mastery over the udana nerve current (the upward vital air), one accomplishes levitation over water, swamps, thorns, etc. and can leave the body at will.",
"41. By mastery over the samana nerve current (the equalizing vital air) comes radiance to surround the body.",
"42. By samyama on the relationship between ear and ether, supernormal hearing becomes possible.",
"43. By samyama on the relationship between the body and ether, lightness of cotton fiber is attained, and thus traveling through the ether becomes possible.",
"44. By samyama on thought waves unidentified by and external to the body [maha-videha, or the great bodilessness], the veil over the light of the Self is destroyed.",
"45. By samyama on the gross and subtle elements and on their essential nature, correlations and purpose, mastery over them is gained.",
"46. From that comes attainment of anima and other siddhis, bodily perfection and the non-obstruction of bodily functions by the influence of the elements. [Note: The eight major siddhis alluded to here are: anima (to become very small); mahima (to become very big); laghima (very light); garima (heavy); prapti (to reach anywhere); prakamya (to achieve all one's desires); isatva (ability to create anything); vasitva (ability to command and control everything).",
"47. Beauty, grace, strength, and adamantine hardness constitute bodily perfection.",
"48. By samyama on the power of perception and on the essential nature, correlation with the ego sense and purpose of the sense organs, mastery over them is gained.",
"49. From that, the body gains the power to move as fast as the mind, ability to function without the aid of the sense organs, and complete mastery over the primary cause (Prakriti).",
"50. By recognition of the distinction between sattva (the pure reflective nature) and the Self, supremacy over all states and forms of existence [omnipotence] is gained as is omniscience.",
"51. By non-attachment even to that [all these siddhis], the seed of bondage is destroyed and thus follows Kaivalya (Independence).",
"52. The Yogi should neither accept nor smile with pride at the admiration of even the celestial beings, as there is the possibility of his getting caught again in the undesirable.",
"53. By samyama on single moments in sequence comes discriminative knowledge.",
"54. Thus, the indistinguishable differences between objects that are alike in species, characteristic marks and positions become distinguishable.",
"55. The discriminative knowledge that simultaneously comprehends all objects in all conditions is the intuitive knowledge which brings liberation.",
"56. When the tranquil mind attains purity equal to that of the Self, there is Absoluteness.",
],[
"1. Siddhis are born of practices performed in previous births, or by herbs, mantra repetition, asceticism, or by samadhi.",
"2. The transformation of one species into another is brought about by the inflow of Nature.",
"3. Incidental events do no directly cause natural evolution; they just remove the obstacles as a farmer [removes the obstacles in a water course running to his field].",
"4. A Yogi's egoity alone is the cause of [other artificially] created minds.",
"5. Although the functions in the many created minds may differ, the original mind-stuff of the Yogi is the director of them all.",
"6. Only the minds born of meditation [the artificially created ones] are free from karmic impressions.",
"7. The actions of the Yogi are neither white [good] nor black [bad]; but the actions of others are of three kinds: good, bad and mixed.",
"8. Of these [actions], only those vasanas (subconscious impressions) for which there are favorable conditions for producing their fruits will manifest in a particular birth.",
"9. Although desires are separated from their fulfillments by class, space and time, they have an uninterrupted relationship because the impressions [of desires] and memories of them are identical.",
"10. Since the desire to live is eternal, impressions are also beginningless.",
"11. The impressions being held together by cause, effect, basis, and support, they disappear with the dissappearance of these four.",
"12. The past and future exist in the real form of objects which manifest due to differences in the conditions of their characteristics.",
"13. Whether manifested or subtle, these characteristics belong to the nature of the gunas.",
"14. The reality of things is due to the uniformity of the gunas' transformations.",
"15. Due to differences in various minds, perception of even the same object may vary.",
"16. Nor does an object's existence depend upon a single mind, for if it did, what would become of that object when that mind did not perceive it?",
"17. An object is known or unknown dependent on whether or not the mind gets colored by it.",
"18. Due to His changelessness, changes in the mind-stuff are always known to the Purusha, who is its Lord.",
"19. The mind-stuff is not self-luminous because it is an object of perception by the Purusha.",
"20. The mind-stuff cannot perceive both subject and object simultaneously [which proves it is not self-luminous].",
"21. If the perception of one mind by another mind be postulated, we would have to assume an endless number of them and the result would be confusion of memory.",
"22. The consciousness of the Purusha  is unchangeable; by getting the reflection of it, the mindstuff becomes conscious of the Self.",
"23. The mind-stuff, when colored by both Seer and seen, understands everything.",
"24. Though having countless desires, the mind-stuff exists for the sake of another [the Purusha] because it an act only in association with it.",
"25. To one who sees the distinction between the mind and the Atman, thoughts of mind as the Atman cease forever.",
"26. Then the mind-stuff is inclined toward discrimination and gravitates toward Absoluteness.",
"27. In between, distracting thoughts may arise due to past impressions.",
"28. They can be removed, as in the case of the obstacles explained before. [See Book 2, Sutras 1, 2, 10, 11 and 26.]",
"29. He who, due to his perfect discrimination, is totally disinterested even in the highest rewards remains in the constant discriminative discernment, which is called dharmamegha (cloud of dharma) samadhi. [Note: The meaning of dharma includes virtue, justice, law, duty, morality, religion, religious merit, and steadfast decree.]",
"30. From that samadhi all afflictions and karmas cease.",
"31. Then all the coverings and impurities of knowledge are totally removed. Because of the infinity of this knowledge, what remains to be known is almost nothing.",
"32. Then the gunas terminate their sequence of transformations because they have fulfilled their purpose.",
"33. The sequence [referred to above] means an uninterrupted succession of moments which can be recognized at the end of their transformations.",
"34. Thus, the supremestate of Independence manifests while the gunas reabsorb themselves into Prakriti, having no more purpose to serve the Purusha, Or, to look from another angle, the power of pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature.",

/* English translation from Inside Patanjali's Words by Reverend Jaganath Carrera */
patanjali_data['jaganath'] = [[
"1. Now is the time for Yoga.",
"2. Yoga ends the misperception that the Seer/Self is the same as the mind's usual tangle of whirling excursions of thought (vrittis).",
"3. When this mistaken perception ends, the Seer: pure, unchanging, eternal consciousness, stands free as the true Self.",
"4. Otherwise, the mind continues to mistake the vrittis as the Self.",
"5. There are five types of vrittis. When they are afflicted by ignorance of one's True Self, they bring pain. Without the influence of ignorance, they are painless.",
"6. The five types are: Reliable knowledge, Unreliable knowledge, Knowledge based on words without substance, Sleep, Remembering.",
"7. Vrittis bring reliable knowledge - knowledge that is trustworthy and useful through: Information obtained from the senses' direct contact with sense objects, Inference properly applied, Authoritative testimony.",
"8. Knowledge is unreliable when based on errors in perception, which result in false information regarding the true nature of an object or event.",
"9. Words without substance is knowledge based on words alone without any tangible reality to verify it.",
"10. Deep sleep occurs when the waking and dreaming states (vrittis) are naturally overcome by inertia. There is only awareness of the thought of non-existence.",
"11. Remembering is the recollecting of objects and occurrences that have been experienced.",
"12. The ingrained habit of mistaking the vrittis as the Self ceases by practice and nonattachment.",
"13. Of these, practice is the regular repeated effort to break free from this misidentification by cultivating steady resolve and a tranquil focused flow of awareness.",
"14. Practice becomes fully integrated into one's life when it is carefully nurtured for a long time and engaged in faithfully, with inner reflection and fervor.",
"15. Nonattachment is self-mastery and freedom from craving. It manifests when love of liberation (from ignorance and the suffering it brings) awakens due to the recognition of the beguiling and captivating nature of craving for objects seen, heard, or described in sacred tradition.",
"16. The highest nonattachment arises when the Purusha is correctly discerned as the True Self. This realization ends all craving, the compulsive urge to find lasting satisfaction from any sense experience that can be provided by nature (gunas, the constituents of nature).",
"17. When practice and nonattachment strengthen, intuitive insight (samprajnata) arises.  As this insight deepens, it reveals four increasingly subtle levels of nature (prakriti), bringing complete and accurate knowledge of the object of contemplation. The four levels are:<p> Vitarka (investigation into the gross form of objects): The mind investigates and gains knowledge of the gross aspect of an object.<p> Vichara (knowledge of subtle essences): The factors that brought the object into existence are revealed.<p> Ananda (bliss of a sattwic mind): At this level, attention naturally turns to awareness itself. Devoid of a gross or subtle object, manas, the part of the mind that constantly seeks objects to grasp, becomes clear and tranquil, resulting in the experience of joy. <p> Asmita (ego sense): The direct experience of the ego-sense, pure I-am-ness.<p> The duality of mind and object remains in all these states.",
"18. Another, deeper insight manifests with the sustained practice of quieting all conscious thoughts, intentions, and expectations until only subconscious impressions (samskaras) remain. Since there are no objects in the conscious mind to investigate and therefore, no insights to be had, this experience is referred to as asamprajnata samadhi, beyond insights (or beyond discerning).",
"19. Unresolved or unexpressed feelings and intentions can cause the individual to become melded with prakriti (through thoughts of continued existence) and subject to rebirth. This can be true even for celestial beings who are without gross physical bodies.",
"20. Others, aware of how attachments hinder progress, continue to strive to attain (the highest) samadhi, a state preceded by: Faith, Courage to face obstacles and the persistence to carry on, Remembrance of life's lessons and repeated recollection of the truths of sacred wisdom traditions, (lower) States of contemplative absorption (samadhi), a clear, tranquil, one-pointed mind, Intuitive insights which remove ignorance.",
"21. Success is near for those whose resolve is unrestrained - fervent and unwavering.",
"22. Understanding the power of resolve, one can infer that nearness of success depends on the degree of its steadiness and intensity: mild, moderate, or fervent.",
"23. Or asamprajnata samadhi can be attained by wholehearted devotion and dedication to Ishwara, which displaces self-centered personal desires and naturally fosters contemplative absorption.",
"24. Ishwara is a unique Purusha. It is never touched by the root causes of suffering (klesas), the entanglements created by actions, their reactions (karma), and the subconscious impressions (samskaras) produced by these actions.",
"25. There, in Ishwara, is the seed of omniscience, which surpasses all other sources of knowledge and ideas of omniscience. It is beyond what is known by gods, clergy, and philosophers.",
"26. Not bound by time, Ishwara is the guru of even the most ancient gurus.",
"27. Ishwara expresses as the primordial sound OM, also known as pranava.",
"28. Repeat it with focus, devotion, and right understanding and the purpose of this practice is revealed.",
"29. From this practice, awareness attains focus and naturally turns within. Not only that, obstacles that distract the mind and obstruct practice vanish.",
"30. The obstacles that distract the mind and disrupt practice are: Disease, Dullness, complacency, narrow-mindedness, Doubt, Carelessness, Laziness, Addiction to sense experiences, Confused, false, or shifting views on principles of life, wisdom teachings, and practice, Failure to reach firm ground, Slipping from the ground gained.",
"31. These distracting obstacles are accompanied by: Duhkha: dissatisfaction, sorrow, suffering, and a pervasive, persistent feeling of precariousness, Frustration from not having desires fulfilled, Restlessness or trembling of the body, Agitated or labored inhalation or exhalation.",
"32. In order to prevent the distracting obstacles and their accompaniments, commit to the teachings and practices of one path.",
"33. The mind becomes calm, clear, and bright when it cultivates and abides in the unconditional virtues of friendliness, compassion, delight, and equanimity in conditions, respectively, of happiness, distress, virtue, and absence of virtue.",
"34. Or by smooth, regulated exhalation and by retention of the breath.",
"35. Or clear steadiness of mind is attained when focus on a sense object causes a subtle sense perception to arise.",
"36. Or by contemplating the supreme radiant light in the heart that is beyond sorrow.",
"37. Or by contemplating the state of a great soul's mind that is free from attachments to sense objects.",
"38. Or by contemplating knowledge revealed through: Dreams, Tranquility of deep sleep, Sense of individuality that persists through the states of wakefulness, dreamless sleep, and dreams.",
"39. Or by meditating on any suitable object that inspires you.",
"40. When any meditation practice is mastered, the mind is freed from the distracting obstacles. Then the mind is able to focus its attention on anything from the smallest particle to the greatest magnitude.",
"41. With regular practice and nonattachment, the vrittis dwindle, weaken, and cease. As a result, the faculties of the mind become absorbed on the object of contemplation. The mind becomes like a naturally flawless transparent crystal that assumes the shapes and colors of objects nearby. This experience, called samapatti (or samadhi), is the union of knower, the object known, and the act of attaining knowledge.",
"42. There are levels of samadhi. In the first, mingling of the word, form, and knowledge regarding the object of contemplation persist. This is known as savitarka samadhi, or samadhi accompanied by concepts (of the object).",
"43. On the next level, the memory is completely cleared of all words, forms, knowledge, and concepts regarding the object of contemplation. It's as if the mind gives up its own intentions and identity so that only the object of contemplation shines forth in its own nature. This is called nirvitarka samadhi, the samadhi free of any concepts associated with the object.",
"44. The next two levels of samadhi are deeper, but can be explained in the same way as the previous two. They are practiced on the subtle nature of objects and are known as savichara, with insight, and nirvichara, beyond insight.",
"45. The subtlety of objects for contemplation ends only at what is undefinable: the unmanifest state of matter (prakriti). At this level, since matter has no distinguishing characteristics, there are no objects to perceive. There is just the primordial soup of prakriti.",
"46. These four samadhis still carry the seeds of subconscious impressions (samskaras).",
"47. As nirvichara samadhi fully matures, the luminous tranquil clarity of the supreme inner Self shines forth.",
"48. This state is truth-bearing. It grants intuitive insights into the cosmic order -- the deepest realities of existence: self-identity, the mind, and the universe.",
"49. The purpose of this insight is different from the insights gained from inference or from hearing sacred wisdom teachings. Its unique purpose is to end false identification with the seen (nature, prakriti) by being able to discern the Seer (Self, Purusha) from the seen.",
"50. The samskara born of this insight displaces all other samskaras.",
"51. When even this impression (samskara) stills, all mental processes -- conscious and subconscious -- are stilled. This is the seedless (nirbija) samadhi, the state that transcends ignorance and brings liberation.",
],[
"1. Kriya yoga, the three elements that form the foundation of the yoga life, are: Tapas -- self-discipline and accepting hardship and pain as a help for purification; Svadhyaya -- repeated, deep study of sacred wisdom and the introspective search into the nature of the self, mantra repetition;  Ishwara pranidhanam -- wholehearted devotion and dedication to Ishwara.",
"2. Their purpose is to cultivate samadhi and to weaken and diminish the klesas.",
"3. The klesas are ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and clinging to bodily life.",
"4. Ignorance is the origin of the other klesas, whether they are dormant, weakened, interrupted, or fully active.",
"5. Ignorance is rooted in misperception. It is due to experiencing: What changes as  unchanging, What is impure, colored by bias, and nonvirtuous as pure, free of bias, and virtuous, What brings pain, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and distress as that which brings serenity, contentment, fulfillment, and happiness, What is not the Self as the Self.",
"6. Egoism arises from confusion, regarding the power of the Seer and the power of the instrument of seeing (mind/intellect) as the same thing.",
"7. Attachment arises from clinging to pleasurable experiences.",
"8. Aversion arises from clinging to painful experiences.",
"9. Clinging to life arises even in the wise and learned. It persists because it is innate.",
"10. The klesas are overcome in their subtle form (subconscious impressions) when the mind returns to its original, pure state.",
"11. In their gross, active manifestations they can be overcome by meditation.",
"12. The residue of karma, the latent impressions produced by past actions, is rooted in the klesas. The effect of these impressions is experienced in present or future births.",
"13. As long as ignorance, the source of the klesas exists, karma produces fruits in the form each birth takes, its life span, and its experiences.",
"14. These fruits can be either sweet or bitter -- pleasurable or painful -- depending on whether they were caused by virtuous or nonvirtuous acts.",
"15. Those who investigate the ways of life find that pain, sorrow, dissatisfaction, and a feeling of persistent, pervasive precariousness are surely a part of all experiences. This is duhkha. It is due to: Fear over losing what is gained, The impermanence of all things, Subconscious habit patterns (samskaras) created under the influence of ignorance that sustain craving and ignorance, Changes of mood and mindset due to the interplay of the gunas that vie for dominance in the mind.",
"16. The duhkha that has not yet come can be avoided.",
"17. The duhkha that can be prevented is caused by confusing the nature of the Seer with that of the seen.",
"18. The seen consists of the five elements and sense organs and has the qualities of translucence, activity, and inertia. Its purpose is to provide experiences and liberation.",
"19. There are four different stages of the evolution of the seen. They are, from gross to subtle: Discernible by the senses: gross elements, Not discernible by the senses: subtle elements, The discriminative faculty (buddhi), the first product of prakriti, Undifferentiated matter, the gunas in equilibrium without any form.",
"20. The Seer is nothing but the sheer power of seeing - pure consciousness. Although it is pure and unchanging, it appears to have the qualities and contents of the mind.",
"21. The seen is worthwhile, beautiful, and pleasing since it has meaning - its nature and essence is truly for the purpose of experience and liberation.",
"22. For the liberated, the purpose of the seen - providing experiences and liberation - is fulfilled. It's as if it disappears, although it doesn't really vanish since the experience of its reality and its relevance is common to others.",
"23. Confusing the natures and powers of the Owner (Seer) and owned (seen) creates the condition for perceiving them as one.",
"24. Ignorance is the cause of confusing the Seer and seen as one.",
"25. Without ignorance, this confusion ceases to exist. The Seer stands apart from the seen as the Self. This is liberation (kaivalya).",
"26. The remedy that removes ignorance is viveka which perceives the difference between the Seer and seen.",
"27. For the yogi who attains this viveka, seven insights arise that lead to the final stage -- liberation.",
"28. By integrating the limbs of Yoga into daily life, impurities -- all born from the klesas -- dwindle away. The mind becomes illumined with the light of wisdom, culminating in viveka.",
"29. The eight limbs of yoga are:<br> Yama : universal resolves that foster harmonious relationships to self, others, and life<br> Niyama : additional resolves taken on by yogis to encourage spiritual growth<br> Asana : posture<br> Pranayama : regulation of breath<br> Pratyahara : management and withdrawal of the senses<br> Dharana : concentration<br> Dhyana : meditation<br> Samadhi : absorption",
"30. Yama -- the universal resolves -- consists of: Ahimsa - harmlessness, Satya - truthfulness , Asteya - nonstealing , Brahmacharya - a life dedicated to self-mastery and liberation , Aparigraha - freedom from craving to possess sense objects.",
"31. The yamas are universal resolves for proper behavior in society. They are bright lights that reveal the way to a life of virtue and joy. Because they hold the capacity to bring peace and harmony, they apply to every being, regardless of social status, time, or circumstance.",
"32. Niyama -- additional resolves yogis observe - consists of: Saucha - purity ; Santosha - contentment ; Tapas - accepting challenge, struggle, discomfort, and self-discipline as a help for purification; Svadhyaya - repeated deep study of sacred wisdom and the introspective search into the nature of the self; mantra repetition, Ishwara pranidhanam - wholehearted devotion and dedication to Ishwara.",
"33. When doubt or wayward thoughts disturb the cultivation of the yamas and niyamas, generate the opposite: a counterforce of thoughts, images, or feelings that have the power to uplift, invigorate, inspire, and steady the mind. This is pratipaksha bhavana.",
"34. Dubious reasoning and wayward thoughts such as causing harm, etc., whether done, incited, or approved of; whether arising from lust, anger, or delusion; and regardless of being mild, medium, or extreme in intensity, have ignorance duhkha as their fruits. Reflecting on this is also pratipaksha bhavana.",
"35. In the presence of one who is firmly established in nonviolence, hostility recedes.",
"36. On being firmly grounded in truthfulness, every thought, word, and deed will be an expression of the nature of sat: truth, existence, that which is good, real, authentic, wise, venerable, and which is in harmony with the essential nature of a being.",
"37. On being firmly grounded in nonstealing, all that is truly valuable comes near.",
"38. On being firmly grounded in brahmacharya, one gains the power to endure, persevere, and succeed.",
"39. The meaning of life awakens when freedom from sense craving is unwavering.",
"40. From purity, one's instinctive protective intelligence awakens. Infatuation with one's own body as well as sensual contact with others that is incompatible with the goal of yoga is naturally avoided.",
"41. Furthermore, when the mind is purified, it becomes clear and steady (sattwic). From this arises cheerfulness, one-pointedness, mastery of the senses, and fitness for Self-realization.",
"42. By contentment, the swift, easy flow of supreme joy is attained.",
"43. From the fire of self-discipline and the acceptance of life's inevitable hardships - and the lessons that can be learned from them - impurities evaporate and the full manifestation of the powers of the body and senses arise.",
"44. By the repeated study and integration of sacred wisdom, and the repetition of mantras, seekers create the condition for experiencing communion with their ishta devata - the symbol, image, or enlightened being that is their most cherished connection with divinity.",
"45. By wholehearted dedication to Ishwara, samadhi can be perfected or attained.",
"46. Asana should be steady and easeful.",
"47. Asana naturally becomes steady and easeful by relaxing physical effort and contemplating one's connection with the infinite. The yogi rests like the cosmic serpent Ananta, floating on the primordial waters, on whom rests Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe.",
"48. From this, one is undisturbed by dualities.",
"49. When a steady, easeful asana is achieved, pranayama can be practiced by regulating the movements of inhalation and exhalation.",
"50. The movements of the breath - inhalation, exhalation, and retention - are regulated according to the: Area of focus during practice, Length of time of inhalation, exhalation, and retention, Number of repetitions . With practice, it will be perceived that the breath becomes subtle and penetrates deeply.",
"51. There is a fourth pranayama that transcends efforts to regulate the internal and external movements of the breath. It is a natural spontaneous suspension of breathing that occurs when the mind is steady.",
"52. Then the veil that obscures the inner light (sattwa) dissipates.",
"53. And the mind attains dharana, the ability to hold focused attention. (See 1.34, 1.40)",
"54. When the mind is indrawn, the senses follow, withdrawing from sense objects. This is pratyahara, sense management.",
"55. From this practice, the highest mastery of the senses arises.",
],[
"1. The practice of nurturing and holding a flow of attention toward one chosen object, place, or idea is dharana.",
"2. When the mind achieves an effortless unbroken flow of attention toward that one object, that is dhyana.",
"3. By continuing in this manner, the flow of attention becomes prolonged until samadhi - a state of mental integration and absorption -- certainly arises. In this state, it's as if the mind gives up its own form so that the essence of the object alone shines forth.",
"4. When these three - dharana, dhyana, and samadhi, are all directed toward one object, it is called samyama.",
"5. With mastery of samyama, the penetrating light of intuitive insight arises.",
"6. Mastery of samyama progresses in stages.",
"7. Compared to the preceding five limbs, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi are more inwardly directed.",
"8. But even these three are external compared to the seedless (nirbija) samadhi which transcends ignorance and brings liberation.",
"9. This is how nirodha develops until it permeates the mind. Practice and nonattachment generate subconscious impressions of nirodha. As each moment of nirodha appears, it subdues the impressions that perpetuate the fluctuating, externalized states of mind.",
"10. When impressions of nirodha become strong and pervasive, a calm flow of nirodha is attained.",
"11. As all of the various distractions to nirodha dwindle, the one-pointed awareness that cultivates samadhi arises.",
"12. From repeated practice, the subsiding and arising thoughts become identical. Sustaining this one-pointed awareness develops samadhi.",
"13. By understanding the transformations of mind, we can also understand the transformations of the form, characteristics, and condition of the elements of nature and the senses.",
"14. Prakriti is the substratum of the changes of form and characteristics that objects exhibit as they go through the succession of stages: Subsiding (past), Arising (present), Unmanifest (future).",
"15. The transformation of characteristics that manifest in objects is caused by the succession of these three phases. (However, there is only one underlying substance.)",
"16. By samyama on these three phases of transformation, knowledge of past and future can be known.",
"17. A word, the object it refers to, and the ideas associated with that object are normally superimposed on one another, creating one unified impression in the mind. By samyama on the distinction between these three factors, knowledge of the meaning of the sounds produced by all beings is attained.",
"18. By samyama on the subconscious impressions that form the mind's deep-rooted tendencies comes direct perception of them. From this, knowledge of previous births is obtained.",
"19. By samyama on the ideas and intentions of others arises the ability to know their minds.",
"20. But this knowledge does not include the object on which the thoughts are based since it is not the purpose of this perception.",
"21. By samyama on the visible form of the body comes the understanding that vision is the ability to perceive the light that is reflected off of objects. Arising from this is the capacity to intercept the light from the eyes of observers, making one's body invisible to them.",
"22. In the same way, the disappearance of sound, touch, taste, smell, etc., is explained.",
"23. There are two categories of karma: karmas that are active during the present lifetime and karmas that are deferred for future births. From samyama on the distinction between these two, or on omens found in natural phenomena, knowledge of the time of death arises.",
"24. By samyama on friendliness, compassion, selfless joy, equanimity, and other such virtues, their full powers manifest.",
"25. By samyama on the strength of elephants and other such animals, their strength is attained.",
"26. By samyama on the inner light (sattwa) that illumines sense perception, one gains knowledge of objects that are subtle, hidden from view, or distant.",
"27. By samyama on the sun, knowledge of all planes of existence in the universe is attained.",
"28. By samyama on the moon, knowledge of the stars' alignment is attained.",
"29. By samyama on the pole star, knowledge of the stars' movements is attained.",
"30. By samyama on the navel plexus, knowledge of the body's constitution is attained.",
"31. By samyama on the pit of the throat, cessation of hunger and thirst is attained.",
"32. By samyama on the tortoise-shaped channel located in the chest, one's body and mind become steady.",
"33. By samyama on the light just below the crown of the head, vision (darshan) of the siddhas, perfected beings, can be attained.",
"34. Or, any or all of the accomplishments listed in the previous seventeen sutras, can come spontaneously -- without samyama -- when the light of intuitive insight bursts forth in a pure, clear, steady mind.",
"35. By samyama on the heart, the center of an individual's consciousness, there arises full knowledge of the mind and its source.",
"36. Sattwa, the pure, luminous intellect, and the Purusha, the power of awareness, are distinct realities. The intellect exists for the Purusha. The Purusha, beyond the limit of the intellect, exists to express its own inherent and true meaning. Failure to perceive the distinction between the two is the cause of all experiences of pleasure and pain. By samyama on this distinction, knowledge of the Purusha is attained.",
"37. From this knowledge, the powers of intuitive hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell are born spontaneously, without the practice of samyama.",
"38. Although these powers may be considered as great accomplishments to an outwardly directed mindset, they obstruct the highest samadhi.",
"39. When the subconscious impressions that bind the mind to the body are loosened and the mind's pathway into and out of the body is perceived, one can join with, and function through, another's body.",
"40. Two versions are possible for the next sutra. The first is more literal and is the one found in virtually every translation of the Yoga Sutras. The second looks at the sutra more symbolically, perhaps with a sense of humor.<p>1.  By mastery over udana, the upward moving current of prana, one moves without obstruction over water, swamps, and thorns, etc., there is a rising above them.<p>2. By mastery over udana, the upward moving current of prana, one moves through the world free from nonvirtuous acts, moral impurity, and confusion. This uplifting of consciousness brings transformation.",
"41. Samana prana is the vital energy that governs physical and mental transformation. By mastering it, one gains radiance of body and mind.",
"42. By samyama on the relationship between hearing and akasha, one can perceive sounds (such as the pranava, OM) through which divine knowledge is gained. (See 3.37)",
"43. By samyama on the connection between the body and ether and from contemplative absorption (samadhi) on the lightness of cotton fiber, one can move unrestricted through space.",
"44. When the mind's activities are genuinely experienced as external -- not limited -- to the body, it is called the great bodiless awareness. From this experience, the veil that obscures the light of the pure sattwic mind is completely removed.",
"45. Mastery over the elements is gained by samyama on their: Gross form -- that which can be perceived by the senses, Essential character -- the special features that distinguish one element from another, Subtle form -- the essence or potential that gives rise to the material elements, Relationship to the gunas -- which are common to all objects, Purpose for being -- which is to bring experience and liberation to the Purusha.",
"46. From that samyama arises powers such as the ability to become minute, perfection of the body, and freedom from the limitations of the elements that form it.",
"47. Perfection of the body is a physical form that is solid, well proportioned, and stable. It possesses potent strength and radiates gracefulness.",
"48. By samyama on the essential nature of the senses -- the factors that work together to create sense perception - mastery over the sense organs is gained. These factors are: Reception of input: the mind (manas) responds to stimuli through the sense organs, Illumination: sattwa, the precursor and essential nature of the sense organs, which illumines the process of perception with the light of consciousness, Ego sense: identification of sense experiences as self, Interconnected relationship: as products of the gunas, the above three aspects work together, Purpose: to give experiences and liberation to the Purusha.",
"49. From mastery over the senses, one gains swiftness of mind, a state with the capacity for sense perception without the aid of the sense organs, and mastery over primordial matter (prakriti).",
"50. One who attains the capacity to discern the distinction between the clear, luminous state of sattwa and the Purusha without confusing the nature of each, attains supremacy over all states of being and becoming (omnipotence) and knowledge of all (omniscience).",
"51. By nonattachment to even omnipotence and omniscience, ignorance, the seed of all the klesas, is destroyed and liberation is experienced.",
"52. Invitations to display siddhis should be rejected whether extended by those of high social status, those in authority, or by celestial beings who promise the joys of heaven. Fostered by adulation and flattery, such associations could generate undesirable consequences: renewed worldly attachment, arrogance, and pride.",
"53. By samyama on the present moment and on the moments that follow, intuitive knowledge born of viveka arises.",
"54. From this intuitive knowledge, arises the ability to discern the difference between two things -- Sattwa and Purusha -- that are almost identical, that cannot be distinguished by origin, characteristics, and location.",
"55. Knowledge born of viveka is transcendent and liberating. Free from the bonds of time, it encompasses all objects in all conditions simultaneously.",
"56. When the mind attains purity of sattwa that is equal to the purity of the Purusha (Self), kaivalya dawns.",
],[
"1. Siddhis may also be born from practices performed in previous births, by herbs, mantra repetition, asceticism, or as a side-effect of samadhi.",
"2. The transformations and attributes that manifest at each birth are the result of the inflow of the vast, innate potentials of prakriti under the influence of the individual's subconscious impressions (samskaras).",
"3. Efforts don't directly initiate this inflow. Effort, like a farmer removing obstacles to the flow of water, removes obstacles to the evolutionary streams of nature (prakriti).",
"4. Individual minds are created from the primary ego sense (asmita matrat)- the principle of individuation.",
"5. Although the activities of the many minds are diverse, the one primary ego sense is the origin of them all.",
"6. Of these activities, those born of meditation leave no subconscious karmic residue.",
"7. The actions of the yogi are neither white (good) nor black (bad); the actions of others are of three kinds: white, black, and mixed.",
"8. From the three categories of karma -- white, black, mixed -- only those vasanas that are suitable to this birth manifest.",
"9. Although the creation of the vasanas that manifest as an individual's present characteristics may be separated from each other by birth, place, and time, there is continuity of selfhood because the memories that form one's present traits are taken from the mind's storehouse of samskaras.",
"10. And these vasanas have no beginning since the desire for continued existence that sustains them is also without beginning.",
"11. The vasanas are held together by the interdependence of: Cause and effect (karma), which leaves subconscious memories and desires , The foundation (ignorance), the klesas, as well as being the root of karma, Support (sense experiences) that sustain desires through attachment and aversion. When these factors are absent, the vasanas disappear.",
"12. The past and future characteristics of an object that manifest during the course of its existence are innate to its nature.",
"13. These characteristics, whether manifest or intangible, have the three fundamental components of nature (gunas) as their essence.",
"14. The transformations of these gunas are unique to the nature of an object. This is why the essential nature of an object remains consistent throughout all of its changes.",
"15. Each mind perceives the same object differently. Even though the object is the same, perception of it is influenced by each mind's unique viewpoints, priorities, and experiences.",
"16. An object's existence doesn't depend on a single mind's perception of it. If it did, what would become of that object when it is not being perceived by that mind?",
"17. An object is known or unknown depending on whether it colors the mind.",
"18. All of the mind's seesaw whirling excursions (vrittis) -- all its changes and fluctuations - are always known to the mind's transcendent sovereign -- the eternal changeless consciousness (Seer, Self, Purusha).",
"19. The mind, like everything in nature, is an object of perception. Therefore, it is not self-illuminating; awareness is not its essential nature.",
"20. A further proof that the mind is not self-illuminating is that it cannot perceive both itself and an object at the same time.",
"21. If it is thought that each mind has a second that illumines the first, it would suggest that there is an endless series of intellects, each perceiving another. The result would be confusion of memory.",
"22. Transcendent unchanging consciousness (Purusha) reflects on the mind making it seem as if the mind possesses awareness of its own.",
"23. The mind, colored by both the Seer and the seen, can perceive all objects.",
"24. The mind, a composite made up of several elements and streaked with countless subconscious impressions, desires, and tendencies, acts for the purpose of another (the Purusha).",
"25. For one who discerns the distinction between the mind and the Atman (Self), false or limited notions of self-identity cease forever.",
"26. Then, the mind naturally inclines toward discriminative discernment and, not being far from liberation, gravitates toward it.",
"27. The flow of discriminative discernment may be interrupted now and then by the force of subconscious impressions (samskaras), which cause distracting thoughts to arise.",
"28. These samskaras can be removed in the same way as was described for the root causes of suffering (klesas): Meditation (2.11), Tracing them back to their cause (2.10), Uninterrupted discriminative discernment (2.26).",
"29. One who does not seek personal gain from even the highest insights, remains in a state of discriminative discernment under all circumstances. From this, arises the cloud of dharma samadhi (dharmamegha samadhi). (See 1.16)",
"30. This samadhi ends the influences of the root causes of suffering (klesas) and past actions (karma).",
"31. At that time, knowledge that is boundless and eternal arises and all impurities and obstructions withdraw. Compared to this knowledge, what remains to be known is of no consequence to the attainment of liberation.",
"32. From this knowledge the purpose of the gunas and their succession of transformations is fulfilled.",
"33. The series of transformations correlate to moments -- time -- which is transcended when the transformations end.",
"34. The three qualities of nature (gunas), having concluded their purpose for the Purusha, return to their original state of equilibrium. In other words, the power of pure consciousness stands steadfast and unchanging in its essential nature as the Self. This is liberation.<p>It is thus.",

"6. (They are) right knowledge, wrong knowledge, fancy, sleep, and memory.",
"7. (Facts of) right knowledge (are based on) direct cognition, inference or testimony.",
"8. Wrong knowledge is a false conception of a thing whose real form does not correspond to such a mistaken conception.",
"9. An image conjured up by words without any substance behind it is fancy.",
"10. That modification of the mind which is based on the absence of any content in it is sleep.",

"12. Their suppression (is brought about) by persistent practice and non-attachment.",

"14. It (Abhyasa) becomes firmly grounded on being continued for a long time, without interruption and with reverent devotion.",
"15. The consciousness of perfect mastery (of desires) in the case of one who has ceased to crave for objects, seen or unseen, is Vairagya.",
"16. That is the highest Vairagya in which, on account of the awareness of the Purusa, there is cessation of the least desire for the Gunas.",
"17. Samprajnata Samadhi is that which is accompanied by reasoning, reflection, bliss and sense of pure being.",

"17. The cause of that which is to be avoided is the union of the Seer and the Seen.",
"18. The Seen (objective side of manifestation) consists of the elements and sense-organs, is of the nature of cognition, activity and stability (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) and has for its purpose (providing the Purusa with) experience and liberation.",
"19. The stages of the Gunas are the particular, the universal, the differentiated and the undifferentiated.",

"33. When the mind is disturbed by improper thoughts constant pondering over the opposites (is the remedy).",
"34. As improper thoughts, emotions (and actions) such as those of violence etc., whether they are done (indulged in), caused to be done or abetted, whether caused by greed, anger or delusion, whether present in mild, medium or intense degree, result in endless pain and ignorance; so there is the necessity of pondering over the opposites.",

"34. (Knowledge of) everything from intuition.",
"35. (By performing Samyama) on the heart, awareness of the nature of the mind.",
"36. Experience is the result of inability to distinguish between the Purusa and the Sattva though they are absolutely distinct. Knowledge of the Purusa results from Samyama on the Self-interest (of the Purusa) apart from another's interest (of Prakrti).",

"21. If cognition of one mind by another (be postulated) we would have to assume cognition of cognitions and confusion of memories also.",

"30. Then follows freedom from Klesas and Karmas.",
"31. Then, in consequence of the removal of all obscuration and impurities, that which can be known (through the mind) is but little in comparison with the infinity of knowledge (obtained in Enlightenment).",
"32. The three Gunas having fulfilled their object, the process of change (in the Gunas) comes to an end.",
"33. The process, corresponding to moments which become apprehensible at the final end of transformation (of the Gunas), is Kramah.",
"34. Kaivalya is the state (of Enlightenment) following remergence of the Gunas because of their becoming devoid of the object of the Purusa. In this state the Purusa is established in his Real nature which is pure Consciousness. Finis."

"11. The weakening of scattered attention and the rise of one-pointed attention in the citta is the transformation towards samadhi.",

"33. By performing samyama on the light of the crown of the head (ajna cakra), the yogi has visions of perfected beings.",
"34. Through the faculty of spiritual perception the yogi becomes the knower of all knowledge.",
"35. By samyama on the region of the heart, the yogi acquires a thorough knowledge of the contents and tendencies of consciousness.",
"36. By samyama, the yogi easily differentiates between the intelligence and the soul which is real and true.",
"37. Through that spiritual perception, the yogi acquires the divine faculties of hearing, touch, vision, taste and smell. He can even generate these divine emanations by his own will.",
"38. These attainments are impediments to samadhi, although they are powers in active life.",
"39. Through relaxation of the causes of bondage, and the free flow of consciousness, the yogi enters another's body at will.",
"40. By mastery of udan vayu, the yogi can walk over water, swamps and thorns without touching them. He can also levitate.",
"41. By samyama on samana vayu, a yogi glows like fire and his aura shines.",
"42. By samyama on the relation between space and sound, the yogi acquires the power of hearing distant and divine sounds. The organ of hearing, the ear, grasps sound in space. This is the conquest of air.",
"43. By knowing the relationship between the body and ether, the yogi transforms his body and mind so that they become as light as cotton fibre. He can then levitate in space. This is the conquest of ether.",
"44. By samyama on mahavideha (the disembodied state), where consciousness acts outside the body, the veil covering the light of illumination is destroyed.",
"45. By samyama on the elements -- their mass, forms, subtlety, conjunction and purposes -- the yogi becomes Lord over them all.",
"46. From that arises perfection of the body, the ability to resist the play of the elements, and powers such as minuteness.",
"47. Perfection of the body  consists of beauty of form, grace, strength, compactness, and the hardness and brilliance of a diamond.",
"48. Through samyama upon the purpose of the conjunction of the process of knowing, the ego, and nature, there is mastery over the senses.",
"49. By mastery over the senses of perception, the yogi's speed of body, senses and mind matches that of the soul, independent of the primary causes of nature. Unaided by consciousness, he subdues the first principle of nature (mahat).",
"50. Only one who knows the difference between the illuminative intelligence and the seer attains supreme knowledge of all that exists and all that manifests.",
"51. By destruction of the seeds of bondage and the renunciation of even these powers, comes eternal emancipation.",
"52. When approached by celestial beings, there should be neither attachment nor surprise, for undesirable connections can occur again.",
"53. By samyama on moment and on the continuous flow of moments, the yogi gains exalted knowledge, free from the limitations of time and space.",
"54. By this knowledge the yogi is able to distinguish unerringly the differences in similar objects which cannot be distinguished by rank, qualitative signs or position in space.",
"55. The essential characteristic of the yogi's exalted knowledge is that he grasps instantly, clearly and wholly, the aims of all objects without going into the sequence of time or change.",
"56. When the purity of intelligence equals the purity of the soul, the yogi has reached kaivalya, perfection in yoga.",
],[
"1. Accomplishments may be attained through birth, the use of herbs, incantations, self-discipline or samadhi.",
"2. The abundant flow of nature's energy brings about a transformation in one's birth, aiding the process of evolution.",
"3. Nature's efficient cause does not impel its potentialities into action, but helps to remove the obstacles to evolution, just as a farmer builds banks to irrigate his fields.",
"4. Constructed or created mind springs from the sense of individuality (asmita).",
"5. Consciousness is one, but it branches into many different types of activities and innumerable thought-waves.",
"6. Of these activities of consciousness of perfected beings, only those which proceed from meditation are free from latent impressions and influences.",
"7. A yogi's actions are neither white nor black. The actions of others are of three kinds, white, black or grey.",
"8. These three types of actions leave impressions which become manifest when conditions are favourable and ripe.",
"9. Life is a continuous process, even though it is demarcated by race, place and time. Due to the uninterrupted close relationship between memory and subliminal impressions, the fruits of actions remain intact from one life to the next, as if there were no separation between births.",
"10. These impressions, memories and desires have existed eternally, as the desire to live is eternal.",
"11. Impressions and desires are bound together by their dependence upon cause and effect. In the absence of the latter, the former too ceases to function.",
"12. The existence of the past and the future is as real as that of the present. As moments roll into movements which have yet to appear as the future, the quality of knowledge in one's intellect and consciousness is affected.",
"13. The three phases of time intermingle rhythmically and interweave with the qualities of nature. They change the composition of nature's properties into gross and subtle.",
"14. Unity in the mutation of time caused by the abiding qualities of nature, sattva, rajas and tamas, causes modifications in objects, but their unique essence, or reality, does not change.",
"15. Due to the variance in the quality of mind-content, each person may view the same object differently, according to his own way of thinking.",
"16. An object exists independent of its cognizance by any one consciousness. What happens to it when that consciousness is not there to perceive it?",
"17. An object remains known or unknown according to the conditioning or expectation of the consciousness.",
"18. Purusa is ever illuminative and changeless. Being constant and master of the mind, he always knows the moods and modes of consciousness.",
"19. Consciousness cannot illumine itself as it is a knowable object.",
"20. Consciousness cannot comprehend both the seer and itself at the same time.",
"21. If consciousness were manifold in one's being, each cognizing the other, the intelligence too would be manifold, so the projections of mind would be many, each having its own memory.",
"22. Consciousness distinguishes its own awareness and intelligence when it reflects and identifies its source -- the changeless seer -- and assumes his form.",
"23. Consciousness, reflected by the seer as well as by the seen, appears to be all-comprehending.",
"24. Though the fabric of consciousness is interwoven with innumerable desires and subconscious impressions, it exists for the seer on account of its proximity to the seer as well as to the objective world.",
"25. For one who realizes the distinction between citta and atma, the sense of separation between the two disappears.",
"26. Then consciousness is drawn strongly towards the seer or the soul due to the gravitational force of its exalted intelligence.",
"27. Notwithstanding this progress, if one is careless during the interval, a fissure arises due to past hidden impressions, creating division between the consciousness and the seer.",
"28. In the same way as the sadhaka strives to be free from afflictions, the yogi must handle these latent impressions judiciously to extinguish them.",
"29. The yogi who has no interest even in this highest state of evolution, and maintains supreme attentive, discriminative awareness, attains dharma-meghah samadhi: he contemplates the fragrance of virtue and justice.",
"30. Then comes the end of afflictions and of karma.",
"31. The, when the veils of impurities are removed, the highest, subjective, pure, infinite knowledge is attained, and the knowable, the finite, appears as trivial.",
"32. When dharmameghah samadhi is attained, qualities of nature (gunas) come to rest. Having fulfilled their purpose, their sequence of successive mutations is at an end.",
"33. As the mutations of the gunas cease to function, time, the uninterrupted movement of moments, stops. This deconstruction of the flow of tie is comprehensible only at this final stage of emancipation.",
"34. Kaivala, liberation, comes when the yogi has fulfilled the purusarthas, the fourfold aims of life, and has transcended the gunas. Aims and gunas return to their source, and consciousness is established in its own natural purity.",

/* English translation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati) */
patanjali_data["jnanesvara"] = [[
"1. Now, after having done prior preparation through life and other practices, the study and practice of Yoga begins.",
"2. Yoga is the control (nirodhah, regulation, channeling, mastery, integration, coordination, stilling, quieting, setting aside) of the modifications (gross and subtle thought patterns) of the mind field.",
"3. Then the Seer abides in Itself, resting in its own True Nature, which is called Self-realization.",
"4. At other times, when one is not in Self-realization, the Seer appears to take on the form of the modifications of the mind field, taking on the identity of those thought patterns.",
"5. Those gross and subtle thought patterns (vrittis) fall into five varieties, of which some are colored (klishta) and others are uncolored (aklishta).",
"6. The five varieties of thought patterns to witness are: 1) knowing correctly (pramana), 2) incorrect knowing (viparyaya), 3) fantasy or imagination (vikalpa), 4) the object of void-ness that is deep sleep (nidra), and 5) recollection or memory (smriti).",
"7. Of these five, there are three ways of gaining correct knowledge (pramana): 1) perception, 2) inference, and 3) testimony or verbal communication from others who have knowledge.",
"8. Incorrect knowledge or illusion (viparyaya) is false knowledge formed by perceiving a thing as being other than what it really is.",
"9. Fantasy or imagination (vikalpa) is a thought pattern that has verbal expression and knowledge, but for which there is no such object or reality in existence.",
"10. Dreamless sleep (nidra) is the subtle thought pattern which has as its object an inertia, blankness, absence, or negation of the other thought patterns (vrittis).",
"11. Recollection or memory (smriti) is mental modification caused by the inner reproducing of a previous impression of an object, but without adding any other characteristics from other sources.",
"12. These thought patterns (vrittis) are mastered (nirodhah, regulated, coordinated, controlled, stilled, quieted) through practice (abhyasa) and non-attachment (vairagya).",
"13. Practice (abhyasa) means choosing, applying the effort, and doing those actions that bring a stable and tranquil state (sthitau).",
"14. When that practice is done for a long time, without a break, and with sincere devotion, then the practice becomes a firmly rooted, stable and solid foundation.",
"15. When the mind loses desire even for objects seen or described in a tradition or in scriptures, it acquires a state of utter (vashikara) desirelessness that is called non-attachment (vairagya).",
"16. Indifference to the subtlest elements, constituent principles, or qualities themselves (gunas), achieved through a knowledge of the nature of pure consciousness (purusha), is called supreme non-attachment (paravairagya).",
"17. The deep absorption of attention on an object is of four kinds, 1) gross (vitarka), 2) subtle (vichara), 3) bliss accompanied (ananda), and 4) with I-ness (asmita), and is called samprajnata samadhi.",
"18. The other kind of samadhi is asamprajnata samadhi, and has no object in which attention is absorbed, wherein only latent impressions remain; attainment of this state is preceded by the constant practice of allowing all of the gross and subtle fluctuations of mind to recede back into the field from which they arose.",
"19. Some who have attained higher levels (videhas) or know unmanifest nature (prakritilayas), are drawn into birth in this world by their remaining latent impressions of ignorance, and more naturally come to these states of samadhi.",
"20. Others follow a five-fold systematic path of 1) faithful certainty in the path, 2) directing energy towards the practices, 3) repeated memory of the path and the process of stilling the mind, 4) training in deep concentration, and 5) the pursuit of real knowledge, by which the higher samadhi (asamprajnata samadhi) is attained.",
"21. Those who pursue their practices with intensity of feeling, vigor, and firm conviction achieve concentration and the fruits thereof more quickly, compared to those of medium or lesser intensity.",
"22. Because the methods may be applied in slow, medium, or speedy ways, even among those who have such commitment and conviction, there are differences in the rate of progress, resulting in nine grades of practice.",
"23. From a special process of devotion and letting go into the creative source from which we emerged (ishvara pranidhana), the coming of samadhi is imminent.",
"24. That creative source (ishvara) is a particular consciousness (purusha) that is unaffected by colorings (kleshas), actions (karmas), or results of those actions that happen when latent impressions stir and cause those actions.",
"25. In that pure consciousness (ishvara) the seed of omniscience has reached its highest development and cannot be exceeded.",
"26. From that consciousness (ishvara) the ancient-most teachers were taught, since it is not limited by the constraint of time.",
"27. The sacred word designating this creative source is the sound OM, called pranava.",
"28. This sound is remembered with deep feeling for the meaning of what it represents.",
"29. From that remembering comes the realization of the individual Self and the removal of obstacles.",
"30. Nine kinds of distractions come that are obstacles naturally encountered on the path, and are physical illness, tendency of the mind to not work efficiently, doubt or indecision, lack of attention to pursuing the means of samadhi, laziness in mind and body, failure to regulate the desire for worldly objects, incorrect assumptions or thinking, failing to attain stages of the practice, and instability in maintaining a level of practice once attained.",
"31. From these obstacles, there are four other consequences that also arise, and these are: 1) mental or physical pain, 2) sadness or dejection, 3) restlessness, shakiness, or anxiety, and 4) irregularities in the exhalation and inhalation of breath.",
"32. To prevent or deal with these nine obstacle and their four consequences, the recommendation is to make the mind one-pointed, training it how to focus on a single principle or object.",
"33. In relationships, the mind becomes purified by cultivating feelings of friendliness towards those who are happy, compassion for those who are suffering, goodwill towards those who are virtuous, and indifference or neutrality towards those we perceive as wicked or evil.",
"34. The mind is also calmed by regulating the breath, particularly attending to exhalation and the natural stilling of breath that comes from such practice.",
"35. The inner concentration on the process of sensory experiencing, done in a way that leads towards higher, subtle sense perception; this also leads to stability and tranquility of the mind.",
"36. Or concentration on a painless inner state of lucidness and luminosity also brings stability and tranquility.",
"37. Or contemplating on having a mind that is free from desires, the mind gets stabilized and tranquil.",
"38. Or by focusing on the nature of the stream in the dream state or the nature of the state of dreamless sleep, the mind becomes stabilized and tranquil.",
"39. Or by contemplating or concentrating on whatever object or principle one may like, or towards which one has a predisposition, the mind becomes stable and tranquil.",
"40. When, through such practices, the mind develops the power of becoming stable on the smallest size object as well as on the largest, then the mind truly comes under control.",
"41. When the modifications of mind have become weakened, the mind becomes like a transparent crystal, and thus can easily take on the qualities of whatever object observed, whether that object be the observer, the means of observing, or an object observed, in a process of engrossment called samapatti.",
"42. One type of such an engrossment (samapatti) is one in which there is a mixture of three things, a word or name going with the object, the meaning or identity of that object, and the knowledge associated with that object; this engrossment is known as savitarka samapatti (associated with gross objects).",
"43. When the memory or storehouse of modifications of mind is purified, then the mind appears to be devoid of its own nature and only the object on which it is contemplating appears to shine forward; this type of engrossment is known as nirvitarka samapatti.",
"44. In the same way that these engrossments operate with gross objects in savitarka samapatti, the engrossment with subtle objects also operates, and is known as savichara and nirvichara samapatti.",
"45. Having such subtle objects extends all the way up to unmanifest prakriti.",
"46. These four varieties of engrossment are the only kinds of concentrations (samadhi) which are objective, and have a seed of an object.",
"47. As one gains proficiency in the undisturbed flow in nirvichara, a purity and luminosity of the inner instrument of mind is developed.",
"48. The experiential knowledge that is gained in that state is one of essential wisdom and is filled with truth.",
"49. That knowledge is different from the knowledge that is commingled with testimony or through inference, because it relates directly to the specifics of the object, rather than to those words or other concepts.",
"50. This type of knowledge that is filled with truth creates latent impressions in the mind-field, and those new impressions tend to reduce the formation of other less useful forms of habitual latent impressions.",
"51. When even these latent impressions from truth filled knowledge recede along with the other impressions, then there is objectless concentration.",
],[
"1. Yoga in the form of action (kriya yoga) has three parts: 1) training and purifying the senses (tapas), 2) self-study in the context of teachings (svadhyaya), and 3) devotion and letting go into the creative source from which we emerged (ishvara pranidhana).",
"2. That Yoga of action (kriya yoga) is practiced to bring about samadhi and to minimize the colored thought patterns (kleshas).",
"3. There are five kinds of coloring (kleshas): 1) forgetting, or ignorance about the true nature of things (avidya), 2) I-ness, individuality, or egoism (asmita), 3) attachment or addiction to mental impressions or objects (raga), 4) aversion to thought patterns or objects (dvesha), and 5) love of these as being life itself, as well as fear of their loss as being death.",
"4. The root forgetting or ignorance of the nature of things (avidya) is the breeding ground for the other of the five colorings (kleshas), and each of these is in one of four states: 1) dormant or inactive, 2) attenuated or weakened, 3) interrupted or separated from temporarily, or 4) active and producing thoughts or actions to varying degrees.",
"5. Ignorance (avidya) is of four types: 1) regarding that which is transient as eternal, 2) mistaking the impure for pure, 3) thinking that which brings misery to bring happiness, and 4) taking that which is not-self to be self.",
"6. The coloring (klesha) of I-ness or egoism (asmita), which arises from the ignorance, occurs due to the mistake of taking the intellect (buddhi, which knows, decides, judges, and discriminates) to itself be pure consciousness (purusha).",
"7. Attachment (raga) is a separate modification of mind, which follows the rising of the memory of pleasure, where the three modifications of attachment, pleasure, and the memory of the object are then associated with one another.",
"8. Aversion (dvesha) is a modification that results from misery associated with some memory, whereby the three modifications of aversion, pain, and the memory of the object or experience are then associated with one another.",
"9. Even for those people who are learned, there is an ever-flowing, firmly established love for continuation and a fear of cessation, or death, of these various colored modifications (kleshas).",
"10. When the five types of colorings (kleshas) are in their subtle, merely potential form, they are then destroyed by their disappearance or cessation into and of the field of mind itself.",
"11. When the modifications still have some potency of coloring (klishta), they are brought to the state of mere potential by meditation (dhyana).",
"12. Latent impressions that are colored (karmashaya) result from other actions (karmas) that were brought about by colorings (kleshas), and become active and experienced in a current life or a future life.",
"13. As long as those colorings (kleshas) remains at the root, three consequences are produced: 1) birth, 2) span of life, and 3) experiences in that life.",
"14. Because of having the nature of merits or demerits (virtue or vice), these three (birth, span of life, and experiences) may be experienced as either pleasure or pain.",
"15. A wise, discriminating person sees all worldly experiences as painful, because of reasoning that all these experiences lead to more consequences, anxiety, and deep habits (samskaras), as well as acting in opposition to the natural qualities.",
"16. Because the worldly experiences are seen as painful, it is the pain, which is yet to come that is to be avoided and discarded.",
"17. The uniting of the seer (the subject, or experiencer) with the seen (the object, or that which is experienced) is the cause or connection to be avoided.",
"18. The objects (or knowables) are by their nature of: 1) illumination or sentience, 2) activity or mutability, or 3) inertia or stasis; they consist of the elements and the powers of the senses, and exist for the purpose of experiencing the world and for liberation or enlightenment.",
"19. There are four states of the elements (gunas), and these are: 1) diversified, specialized, or particularized (vishesha), 2) undiversified, unspecialized, or unparticularized (avishesha), 3) indicator-only, undifferentiated phenomenal, or marked only (linga-matra), and 4) without indicator, noumenal, or without mark (alingani).",
"20. The Seer is but the force of seeing itself, appearing to see or experience that which is presented as a cognitive principle.",
"21. The essence or nature of the knowable objects exists only to serve as the objective field for pure consciousness.",
"22. Although knowable objects cease to exist in relation to one who has experienced their fundamental, formless true nature, the appearance of the knowable objects is not destroyed, for their existence continues to be shared by others who are still observing them in their grosser forms.",
"23. Having an alliance, or relationship between objects and the Self is the necessary means by which there can subsequently be realization of the true nature of those objects by that very Self.",
"24. Avidya or ignorance, the condition of ignoring, is the underlying cause that allows this alliance to appear to exist.",
"25. By causing a lack of avidya, or ignorance there is then an absence of the alliance, and this leads to a freedom known as a state of liberation or enlightenment for the Seer.",
"26. Clear, distinct, unimpaired discriminative knowledge is the means of liberation from this alliance.",
"27. Seven kinds of ultimate insight come to one who has attained this degree of discrimination.",
"28. Through the practice of the different limbs, or steps to Yoga, whereby impurities are eliminated, there arises an illumination that culminates in discriminative wisdom, or enlightenment.",
"29. The eight rungs, limbs, or steps of Yoga are the codes of self-regulation or restraint (yamas), observances or practices of self-training (niyamas), postures (asana), expansion of breath and prana (pranayama), withdrawal of the senses (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and perfected concentration (samadhi).",
"30. Non-injury or non-harming (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), abstention from stealing (asteya), walking in awareness of the highest reality (brahmacharya), and non-possessiveness or non-grasping with the senses (aparigraha) are the five yamas, or codes of self-regulation or restraint, and are the first of the eight steps of Yoga.",
"31. These codes of self-regulation or restraint become a great vow when they become universal and are not restricted by any consideration of the nature of the kind of living being to whom one is related, nor in any place, time or situation.",
"32. Cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha), an attitude of contentment (santosha), ascesis or training of the senses (tapas), self-study and reflection on sacred words (svadhyaya), and an attitude of letting go into one's source (ishvarapranidhana) are the observances or practices of self-training (niyamas), and are the second rung on the ladder of Yoga.",
"33. When these codes of self-regulation or restraint (yamas) and observances or practices of self-training (niyamas) are inhibited from being practiced due to perverse, unwholesome, troublesome, or deviant thoughts, principles in the opposite direction, or contrary thought should be cultivated.",
"34. Actions arising out of such negative thoughts are performed directly by oneself, caused to be done through others, or approved of when done by others. All of these may be preceded by, or performed through anger, greed or delusion, and can be mild, moderate or intense in nature. To remind oneself that these negative thoughts and actions are the causes of unending misery and ignorance is the contrary thought, or principle in the opposite direction that was recommended in the previous sutra.",
"35. As a Yogi becomes firmly grounded in non-injury (ahimsa), other people who come near will naturally lose any feelings of hostility.",
"36. As truthfulness (satya) is achieved, the fruits of actions naturally result according to the will of the Yogi.",
"37. When non-stealing (asteya) is established, all jewels, or treasures present themselves, or are available to the Yogi.",
"38. hen walking in the awareness of the highest reality (brahmacharya) is firmly established, then a great strength, capacity, or vitality (virya) is acquired.",
"39. When one is steadfast in non-possessiveness or non-grasping with the senses (aparigraha), there arises knowledge of the why and wherefore of past and future incarnations.",
"40. Through cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha), one develops an attitude of distancing, or disinterest towards one's own body, and becomes disinclined towards contacting the bodies of others.",
"41. Also through cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha) comes a purification of the subtle mental essence (sattva), a pleasantness, goodness and gladness of feeling, a one-pointedness with intentness, the conquest or mastery over the senses, and a fitness, qualification, or capability for self-realization.",
"42. From an attitude of contentment (santosha), unexcelled happiness, mental comfort, joy, and satisfaction is obtained.",
"43. hrough ascesis or training of the senses (tapas), there comes a destruction of mental impurities, and an ensuing mastery or perfection over the body and the mental organs of senses and actions (indriyas).",
"44. From self-study and reflection on sacred words (svadhyaya), one attains contact, communion, or concert with that underlying natural reality or force.",
"45. From an attitude of letting go into one's source (ishvarapranidhana), the state of perfected concentration (samadhi) is attained.",
"46. The posture (asana) for Yoga meditation should be steady, stable, and motionless, as well as comfortable, and this is the third of the eight rungs of Yoga.",
"47. The means of perfecting the posture is that of relaxing or loosening of effort, and allowing attention to merge with endlessness, or the infinite.",
"48. From the attainment of that perfected posture, there arises an unassailable, unimpeded freedom from suffering due to the pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, good and bad, or pain and pleasure).",
"49. Once that perfected posture has been achieved, the slowing or braking of the force behind, and of unregulated movement of inhalation and exhalation is called breath control and expansion of prana (pranayama), which leads to the absence of the awareness of both, and is the fourth of the eight rungs.",
"50. That pranayama has three aspects of external or outward flow (exhalation), internal or inward flow (inhalation), and the third, which is the absence of both during the transition between them, and is known as fixedness, retention, or suspension. These are regulated by place, time, and number, with breath becoming slow and subtle.",
"51. The fourth pranayama is that continuous prana which surpasses, is beyond, or behind those others that operate in the exterior and interior realms or fields.",
"52. Through that pranayama the veil of karmasheya (2.12) that covers the inner illumination or light is thinned, diminishes and vanishes.",
"53. Through these practices and processes of pranayama, which is the fourth of the eight steps, the mind acquires or develops the fitness, qualification, or capability for true concentration (dharana), which is itself the sixth of the steps.",
"54. When the mental organs of senses and actions (indriyas) cease to be engaged with the corresponding objects in their mental realm, and assimilate or turn back into the mind-field from which they arose, this is called pratyahara, and is the fifth step.",
"55. Through that turning inward of the organs of senses and actions (indriyas) also comes a supreme ability, controllability, or mastery over those senses inclining to go outward towards their objects.",
],[
"1. Concentration (dharana) is the process of holding or fixing the attention of mind onto one object or place, and is the sixth of the eight rungs.",
"2. The repeated continuation, or uninterrupted stream of that one point of focus is called absorption in meditation (dhyana), and is the seventh of the eight steps.",
"3. When only the essence of that object, place, or point shines forth in the mind, as if devoid even of its own form, that state of deep absorption is called deep concentration or samadhi, which is the eighth rung.",
"4. The three processes of dharana, dhyana, and samadhi, when taken together on the same object, place or point is called samyama.",
"5. Through the mastery of that three-part process of samyama, the light of knowledge, transcendental insight, or higher consciousness (prajna) dawns, illumines, flashes, or is visible.",
"6. That three-part process of samyama is gradually applied to the finer planes, states, or stages of practice.",
"7. These three practices of concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and samadhi are more intimate or internal than the previous five practices.",
"8. However, these three practices are external, and not intimate compared to nirbija samadhi, which is samadhi that has no object, nor even a seed object on which there is concentration.",
"9. That high level of mastery called nirodhah-parinamah occurs in the moment when there is a convergence of the rising tendency of deep impressions, the subsiding tendency, and the attention of the mind field itself.",
"10. The steady flow of this state (nirodhah-parinamah) continues by the creation of deep impressions (samskaras) from doing the practice.",
"11. The mastery called samadhi-parinamah is the transition whereby the tendency to all-pointedness subsides, while the tendency to one-pointedness arises.",
"12. The mastery called ekagrata-parinamah is the transition whereby the same one-pointedness arises and subsides sequentially.",
"13. These three transition processes also explain the three transformations of form, time, and characteristics, and how these relate to the material elements and senses.",
"14. There is an unmanifest, indescribable substratum or existence that is common or contained within all of the other forms or qualities.",
"15. Change in the sequence of the characteristics is the cause for the different appearances of results, consequences, or effects.",
"16. By samyama on the three-fold changes in form, time, and characteristics, there comes knowledge of the past and future.",
"17. The name associated with an object, the object itself implied by that name, and the conceptual existence of the object, all three usually interpenetrate or commingle with one another. By samyama on the distinction between these three, the meaning of the sounds made by all beings becomes available.",
"18. Through the direct perception of the latent impressions (samskaras) comes the knowledge of previous incarnations.",
"19. By samyama on the notions or presented ideas comes knowledge of another's mind.",
"20. But the underlying support of that knowledge (of the other persons mind, in 3.19) remains unperceived or out of reach.",
"21. When samyama is done on the form of one's own physical body, the illumination or visual characteristic of the body is suspended, and is thus invisible to other people.",
"22. In the same way as described in relation to sight (3.21), one is able to suspend the ability of the body to be heard, touched, tasted, or smelled.",
"23. Karma is of two kinds, either fast or slow to manifest; by samyama on these karmas comes foreknowledge of the time of death.",
"24. By samyama on friendliness (and the other attitudes of 1.33), there comes great strength of that attitude.",
"25. By samyama on the strength of elephants comes a similar strength.",
"26. By directing the flash of inner light of higher sensory activity, knowledge of subtle objects, those hidden from view, and those very distant can be attained.",
"27. By samyama on the inner sun, knowledge of the many subtle realms can be known.",
"28. By samyama on the moon, knowledge of the arrangement of the inner stars can be known.",
"29. By samyama on the pole-star, knowledge of the movement of those stars can be known.",
"30. By samyama on the navel center, knowledge of the arrangement of the systems of the body can be known.",
"31. By samyama on the pit of the throat, hunger and thirst leave.",
"32. By samyama on the tortoise channel, below the throat, steadiness is attained.",
"33. By samyama on the coronal light of the head, visions of the siddhas, the masters can come.",
"34. Or, through the intuitive light of higher knowledge, anything might become known.",
"35. By practicing samyama on the heart, knowledge of the mind is attained.",
"36. The having of experiences comes from a presented idea only when there is a commingling of the subtlest aspect of mind (sattva) and pure consciousness (purusha), which are really quite different. Samyama on the pure consciousness, which is distinct from the subtlest aspect of mind, reveals knowledge of that pure consciousness.",
"37. From the light of the higher knowledge of that pure consciousness or purusha (3.36) arises higher, transcendental, or divine hearing, touch, vision, taste, and smell.",
"38. These experiences resulting from samyama are obstacles to samadhi, but appear to be attainments or powers to the outgoing or worldly mind.",
"39. By loosening or letting go of the causes of bondage and attachment, and by following the knowledge of how to go forth into the passages of the mind, there comes the ability to enter into another body.",
"40. By the mastery over udana, the upward flowing prana vayu, there is a cessation of contact with mud, water, thorns, and other such objects, and there ensues the rising or levitation of the body.",
"41. By mastery over samana, the prana flowing in the navel area, there comes effulgence, radiance, or fire.",
"42. By samyama over the relation between space and the power of hearing, the higher, divine power of hearing comes.",
"43. By Samyama on the relationship between the body and space (akasha) and by concentrating on the lightness of cotton, passage through space can be attained.",
"44. When the formless thought patterns of mind are projected outside of the body, it is called maha-videha, a great disincarnate one. By samyama on that outward projection, the veil over the spiritual light is removed.",
"45. By samyama on the five forms of the elements (bhutas), which are gross form, essence, subtleness, interconnectedness, and it's purpose, then mastery over those bhutas is attained.",
"46. Through that mastery over the elements, comes the abilities of making the body atomically small, perfect, and indestructible in its characteristics or components, as well as bringing other such powers.",
"47. This perfection of the body includes beauty, gracefulness, strength, and adamantine hardness in taking the blows that come.",
"48. By samyama on the process of perception and action, essence, I-ness, connectedness, and purposefulness of senses and acts, mastery over those senses and acts (indriyas) is attained.",
"49. By that mastery over the senses and acts (indriyas), there comes quickness of mind, perception with the physical instruments of perception, and mastery over the primal cause out of which manifestation arises.",
"50. To one well established in the knowledge of the distinction between the purest aspect of mind and consciousness itself, there comes supremacy over all forms or states of existence, as well as over all forms of knowing.",
"51. With non-attachment or desirelessness even for that supremacy over forms and states of existence and the omniscience (3.50), the seeds at the root of those bondages are destroyed, and absolute liberation is attained.",
"52. When invited by the celestial beings, no cause should be allowed to arise in the mind that would allow either acceptance of the offer, or the smile of pride from receiving the invitation, because to allow such thoughts to arise again might create the possibility of repeating undesirable thoughts and actions.",
"53. By samyama over the moments and their succession, there comes the higher knowledge that is born from discrimination.",
"54. From that discriminative knowledge (3.53) comes awareness of the difference or distinction between two similar objects, which are not normally distinguishable by category, characteristics, or position in space.",
"55. That higher knowledge is intuitive and transcendent, and is born of discrimination; it includes all objects within its field, all conditions related to those objects, and is beyond any succession.",
"56. With the attainment of equality between the purest aspect of sattvic buddhi and the pure consciousness of purusha, there comes absolute liberation, and that is the end."
],[
"1. The subtler attainments come with birth or are attained through herbs, mantra, austerities or concentration.",
"2. The transition or transformation into another form or type of birth takes place through the filling in of their innate nature.",
"3. Incidental causes or actions do not lead to the emergence of attainments or realization, but rather, come by the removal of obstacles, much like the way a farmer removes a barrier (sluice gate), so as to naturally allow the irrigation of his field.",
"4. The emergent mind fields springs forth from the individuality of I-ness (asmita).",
"5. While the activities of the emergent mind fields may be diverse, the one mind is the director of the many.",
"6. Of these mind fields, the one that is born from meditation is free from any latent impressions that could produce karma.",
"7. The actions of yogis are neither white nor black, while they are threefold for others.",
"8. Those threefold actions result in latent impressions (vasanas) that will later arise to fruition only corresponding to those impressions.",
"9. Since memory (smriti) and the deep habit patterns (samskaras) are the same in appearance, there is an unbroken continuity in the playing out of those traits, even though there might be a gap in location, time, or state of life.",
"10. There is no beginning to the process of these deep habit patterns (samskaras), due to the eternal nature of the will to live.",
"11. Since the impressions (4.10) are held together by cause, motive, substratum, and object, they disappear when those deep impressions disappear.",
"12. Past and future exist in the present reality, appearing to be different because of having different characteristics or forms.",
"13. Whether these ever-present characteristics or forms are manifest or subtle, they are composed of the primary elements called the three gunas.",
"14. The characteristics of an object appear as a single unit, as they manifested uniformly from the underlying elements.",
"15. Although the same objects may be perceived by different minds, they are perceived in different ways, because those minds manifested differently.",
"16. However, the object itself does not depend on any one mind, for if it did, then what would happen to the object if it were not being experienced by that mind?",
"17. Objects are either known or not known according to the way in which the coloring of that object falls on the coloring of the mind observing it.",
"18. The activities of the mind are always known by the pure consciousness, because that pure consciousness is superior to, support of, and master over the mind.",
"19. That mind is not self-illuminating, as it is the object of knowledge and perception by the pure consciousness.",
"20. Nor can both the mind and the illuminating process be cognized simultaneously.",
"21. If one mind were illumined by another, as its master, then there would be an endless and absurd progression of cognitions, as well as confusion.",
"22. When the unchanging consciousness appears to take on the shape of that finest aspect of mind-field (4.18), then the experience of one's own cognition process is possible.",
"23. Therefore, the mind field, which is colored by both seer and seen, has the potential to perceive any and all objects.",
"24. That mind field, though filled with countless impressions, exists for the benefit of another witnessing consciousness, as the mind field is operating only in combination with those impressions.",
"25. For one who has experienced this distinction between seer and this subtlest mind, the false identities and even the curiosity about the nature of one's own self come to an end.",
"26. Then the mind is inclined towards the highest discrimination, and gravitates towards absolute liberation between seer and seen.",
"27. When there are breaks or breaches in that high discrimination, other impressions arise from the deep unconscious.",
"28. The removal of those interfering thought patterns is by the same means by which the original colorings were removed.",
"29. When there is no longer any interest even in omniscience, that discrimination allows the samadhi, which brings an abundance of virtues like a rain cloud brings rain.",
"30. After that dharma-meghah samadhi, the colorings of the kleshas and the karmas are removed.",
"31. Then, by the removal of those veils of imperfection, there comes the experience of the infinite, and the realization that there is almost nothing to be known.",
"32. Also resulting from that dharma-meghah samadhi (4.29), the three primary elements or gunas (4.13-4.14) will have fulfilled their purpose, cease to transform into further transformations, and recede back into their essence.",
"33. The sequencing process of moments and impressions corresponds to the moments of time, and is apprehended at the end point of the sequence.",
"34. When those primary elements involve, or resolve themselves back into that out of which they emerged, there comes liberation, wherein the power of pure consciousness becomes established in its true nature.",

/* How to Know God: The Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali (Swami Prabhavananda, Christopher Isherwood) */
patanjali_data["cisherwood"] = [[
"1. This is the beginning of instruction in yoga.",
"2. Yoga is the control of thought-waves in the mind.",
"3. Then man abides in his real nature.",
"4. At other times, when he is not in the state of yoga, man remains identified with the thought-waves in the mind.",
"5. There are five kinds of thought-waves -- some painful, others not painful.",
"6. These five kinds of thought-waves are: right knowledge, wrong knowledge, verbal delusion, sleep and memory.",
"7. The right kinds of knowledge are: direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony.",
"8. Wrong knowledge is knowledge which is false and not based upon the true nature of its object.",
"9. Verbal delusion arises when words do not correspond to reality.",
"10. Sleep is a wave of thought about nothingness.",
"11. Memory is when perceived objects are not forgotten, but come back to consciousness.",
"12. They are controlled by means of practice and non-attachment.",
"13. Practice is the repeated effort to follow the disciplines which give permanent control of the thought-waves of the mind.",
"14. Practice becomes firmly grounded when it has been cultivated for a long time, uninterruptedly, with earnest devotion.",
"15. Non-attachment is self-mastery; it is freedom from desire for what is seen or heard.",
"16. When, through knowledge of the Atman, one ceases to desire any manifestations of Nature, then that is the highest kind of non-attachment.",
"17. Concentration upon a single object may reach four stages: examination, discrimination, joyful peace and simple awareness of individuality.",
"18. The other kind of concentration is that in which the consciousness contains no object -- only subconscious impressions, which are like burnt seeds. It is attained by constantly checking the thought-waves through the practice of non-attachment.",
"19.  When such concentration is not accompanied by non-attachment, and ignorance therefore remains, the aspirant will reach the state of the disincarnate gods or become merged in the forces of Nature.",
"20. The concentration of the true spiritual aspirant is attained through faith, energy, recollectedness, absorption and illumination.",
"21. Success in yoga comes quickly to those who are intensely energetic.",
"22. Success varies according to the means adopted to obtain it -- mild, medium or intense.",
"23. Concentration may also be attained through devotion to Ishwara.",
"24. Ishwara is a special kind of Being, untouched by ignorance and the products of ignorance, not subject to karmas or samskaras or the results of action.",
"25. In Him, knowledge is infinite; in others it is only a germ.",
"26. He was the teacher even of the earliest teachers, since He is not limited by time.",
"27. The word which express Him is OM.",
"28. This word must be repeated with meditation upon its meaning.",
"29. Hence comes knowledge of the Atman and destruction of the obstacles to that knowledge.",
"30. Sickness, mental laziness, doubt, lack of enthusiasm, sloth, craving for sense-pleasure, false perception, despair caused by failure to concentrate and unsteadiness in concentration: these distractions are the obstacles to knowledge.",
"31. These distractions are accompanied by grief, despondency, trembling of the body and irregular breathing.",
"32. They can be removed by the practice of  concentration upon a single truth.",
"33. Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by cultivating friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference toward the wicked.",
"34. The mind may also be calmed by expulsion and retention of the breath.",
"35. Those forms of concentration which result in extraordinary perceptions encourage perseverance of the mind.",
"36. Concentration may also be attained by fixing the mind upon the Inner Light, which is beyond sorrow.",
"37. Or by meditating on the heart of an illumined soul, that is free from passion.",
"38. Or by fixing the mind upon a dream experience, or the experience of deep sleep.",
"39. Or by fixing the mind upon any divine form or symbol that appeals to one as good.",
"40. The mind of a yogi can concentrate upon any object of any size, from the atomic to the infinitely great.",
"41. Just as the pure crystal takes color from the object which is nearest to it, so the mind, when it is cleared of thought-waves, achieves sameness or identity with the object of its concentration. This may be either a gross object, or the organ of perception, or the sense of ego. This achievement of sameness or identity with the object of concentration is known as samadhi.",
"42. When the mind achieves identity with a gross object of concentration, mixed with awareness of name, quality and knowledge, this is called savitarka samadhi.",
"43. When the mind achieves identity with a gross object of concentration, unmixed with awareness of name, quality and knowledge, so that the object alone remains, this is called nirvitarka samadhi.",
"44. When the object of concentration is a subtle object, two kinds of samadhi, called savichara and nirvichara, may be distinguished in the same manner.",
"45. Behind all subtle objects is Prakriti, the primal cause.",
"46. These kinds of samadhi are said to be 'with seed.'",
"47. In reaching nirvichara samadhi the mind becomes pure.",
"48. In that samadhi, knowledge is said to be 'filled with truth.'",
"49. The knowledge which is gained from inference and the study of scriptures is knowledge of one kind. But the knowledge which is gained from samadhi is of a much higher order. It goes beyond inference and scriptures.",
"50. The impression which is made upon the mind by that samadhi wipes out all other past impressions.",
"51. When the impression made by that samadhi is also wiped out, so that there are no more thought-waves at all in the mind, then one enters the samadhi which is called 'seedless.'",
],[
"1. Austerity, study, and the dedication of the fruits of one's work to God: these are the preliminary steps toward yoga.",
"2. Thus we may cultivate the power of concentration and remove the obstacles to enlightenment which cause all our sufferings.",
"3. These obstacles -- the causes of man's sufferings -- are ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life.",
"4. Ignorance creates all the other obstacles. They may exist either in a potential or a vestigial form, or they may have been temporarily overcome or fully developed.",
"5. To regard the noneternal as eternal, the impure as pure, the painful as pleasant and the non-Atman as the Atman -- this is ignorance.",
"6. To identify consciousness with that which merely reflects consciousness -- this is egoism.",
"7. Attachment is that which dwells upon pleasure.",
"8. Aversion is that which dwells upon pain.",
"9. The desire to cling to life is inherent both in the ignorant and in the learned. This is because the mind retains impressions of the death experience from many previous incarnations.",
"10. When these obstacles have been reduced to a vestigial for, they can be destroyed by resolving the mind back into its primal cause..",
"11. In their fully developed form, they can be overcome through meditation.",
"12. A man's latent tendencies have been created by his past thoughts and actions. These tendencies will bear fruits, both in this life and in lives to come.",
"13. So long as the cause exists, it will bear fruits -- such as rebirth, a long or a short life, and the experiences of pleasure and of pain.",
"14. Experiences of pleasure and of pain are the fruits of merit and demerit, respectively.",
"15. But the man of spiritual discrimination regards all these experiences as painful. For even the enjoyment of present pleasure is painful, since we already fear its loss. Past pleasure is painful because renewed cravings arise from the impressions it has left upon the mind. And how can any happiness be lasting if it depends only upon our moods? For these moods are constantly changing, as one or another of the ever-warring gunas seizes control of the mind.",
"16. The pain which is yet to come may be avoided.",
"17. This pain is caused by false identification of the experiencer with the object of experience. It may be avoided.",
"18. The object of experience is composed of the three gunas -- the principles of illumination (sattwa), activity (rajas) and inertia (tamas). From these, the whole universe has evolved, together with the instruments of knowledge -- such as the mind, senses, etc. -- and the objects perceived -- such as the physical elements. The universe exists in order that the experiencer may experience it, and thus become liberated.",
"19. The gunas pass through four states -- gross, subtle, primal and unevolved.",
"20. The Atman -- the experiencer -- is pure consciousness. It appears to take on the changing colors of the mind. In reality, it is unchangeable.",
"21. The object of experience exists only to serve the purpose of the Atman.",
"22. Though the object of experience becomes unreal to him who has reached the state of liberation it remains real to all other beings.",
"23. The Atman -- the experiencer -- is identified with Prakriti -- the object of experience -- in order that the true nature of both Prakriti and Atman may be known.",
"24. This identification is caused by ignorance.",
"25. When ignorance has been destroyed, this identification ceases. Then bondage is at an end and the experiencer is independent and free.",
"26. Ignorance is destroyed by awakening to knowledge of the Atman, until no trace of illusion remains.",
"27. The experiencer gains this knowledge in seven stages, advancing toward the highest.",
"28. As soon as all impurities have been removed by the practice of spiritual disciplines -- the 'limbs' of yoga -- a man's spiritual vision opens to the light-giving knowledge of the Atman.",
"29. The eight limbs of yoga are: the various forms of abstention from evil-doing (yama), the various observances (niyamas), posture (asana), control of the prana (pranayama), withdrawal of the mind from sense objects (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana) and absorption in the Atman (samadhi).",
"30. Yama is abstention from harming others, from falsehood, from theft, from incontinence, and from greed.",
"31. These forms of abstention are basic rules of conduct. They must be practiced without any reservations as to time, place, purpose, or caste rules.",
"32. The niyamas (observances) are purity, contentment, mortification, study and devotion to God.",
"33. To be free from thoughts that distract one from yoga, thoughts of an opposite kind must be cultivated.",
"34. The obstacles to yoga -- such as acts of violence and untruth -- may be directly created or indirectly caused or approved, they may be motivated by greed, anger or self-interest, they may be small or moderate or great, but they never cease to result in pain and ignorance. One should overcome distracting thoughts by remembering this.",
"35. When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from harming others, then all living creatures will cease to feel enmity in his presence.",
"36. When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from falsehood he gets the power of obtaining for himself and others the fruits of good deeds, without having to perform the deeds themselves.",
"37. When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from theft, all wealth comes to him.",
"38. When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from incontinence, he acquires spiritual energy.",
"39. When a man becomes steadfast in his abstention from greed, he gains knowledge of his past, present and future existences.",
"40. As the result of purity, there arises indifference toward the body and disgust for physical intercourse with others.",
"41. Moreover, one achieves purification of the heart, cheerfulness of mind, the power of concentration, control of the passions and fitness for vision of the Atman.",
"42. As a result of contentment, one gains supreme happiness.",
"43. As the result of mortification, impurities are removed. Then special powers come to the body and the sense-organs.",
"44. As the result of study, one obtains the vision of that aspect of God which one has chosen to worship.",
"45. As the result of devotion to God, one achieves samadhi.",
"46. Posture (asana) is to be seated in a position which is firm but relaxed.",
"47. Posture becomes firm and relaxed through control of the natural tendencies of the body, and through meditation on the Infinite.",
"48. Thereafter, one is no longer troubled by the dualities of sense-experience.",
"49. After mastering posture, one must practice control of the prana (pranayama) by stopping the motions of inhalation and exhalation.",
"50. The breath may be stopped externally, or internally, or checked in mid-motion, and regulated according to place, time and a fixed number of moments, so that the stoppage is either protracted or brief.",
"51. The fourth kind of pranayama is the stoppage of the breath which is caused by concentration upon external or internal objects.",
"52. As the result of this, the covering of the Inner Light is removed.",
"53. The mind gains the power of concentration (dharana).",
"54. When the mind is withdrawn from sense-objects, the sense-organs also withdraw themselves from their respective objects and thus are said to imitate the mind. This is known as pratyahara.",
"55. Thence arises complete mastery over the senses.",
],[
"1. Concentration (dharana) is holding the mind within a center of spiritual consciousness in the body, or fixing it on some divine form, either within the body or outside it.",
"2. Meditation (dhyana) is an unbroken flow of thought toward the object of concentration.",
"3. When, in meditation, the true nature of the object shines forth, not distorted by the mind of the perceiver, that is absorption (samadhi).",
"4. When these three -- concentration, meditation and absorption --  are brought to bear upon one subject, they are called samyama.",
"5. Through mastery of samyama comes the light of knowledge.",
"6. It must be applied stage by stage.",
"7. These three are more direct aids to experience than the five limbs previously described.",
"8. But even these are not direct aids to the seedless samadhi.",
"9. When the vision of the lower samadhi is suppressed by an act of conscious control, so that there are no longer any thoughts or visions in the mind, that is the achievement of control of the thought-waves of the mind.",
"10. When this suppression of thought-waves becomes continuous, the mind's flow is calm.",
"11. When all mental distractions disappear and the mind becomes one-pointed, it enters the state called samadhi.",
"12. The mind becomes one-pointed when similar thought-waves arise in succession without any gaps between them.",
"13. In this state, it passes beyond the three kinds of changes which take place in subtle or gross matter, and in the organs: change of form, change of time and change of condition.",
"14. A compound object has attributes and is subject to change, either past, present or yet to be manifested.",
"15. The succession of these changes is the cause of manifold evolution.",
"16. By making samyama on the three kinds of changes, one obtains knowledge of the past and the future.",
"17. By making samyama on the sound of a word, one's perception of its meaning, and one's reaction to it -- three things which are ordinarily confused -- one obtains understanding of all sounds uttered by living beings.",
"18. By making samyama on previous thought-waves, one obtains knowledge of one's past lives.",
"19. By making samyama on the distinguishing marks of another man's body, one obtains knowledge of the nature of his mind.",
"20. But not of its contents, because that is not the object of the samyama.",
"21. If one makes samyama on the form of one's body, obstructing its perceptibility and separating its power of manifestation from the eyes of the beholder, then one's body becomes invisible.",
"22. Thus, also its sounds cease to be heard.",
"23. By making samyama on two kinds of karma -- that which will soon bear fruit and that which will not bear fruit until later -- or by recognizing the portents of death, a yogi may know the exact time of his separation from the body.",
"24. By making samyama on friendliness, compassion, etc., one develops the powers of these qualities.",
"25. By making samyama on any kind of strength, such as that of the elephant, one obtains that strength.",
"26. By making samyama on the Inner Light, one obtains knowledge of what is subtle, hidden, or far distant.",
"27. By making samyama on the sun, one gains knowledge of the cosmic spaces.",
"28. By making samyama on the moon, one gains knowledge of the arrangement of the stars.",
"29. By making samyama on the polestar, one gains knowledge of the motions of the stars.",
"30. By making samyama on the navel, one gains knowledge of the constitution of the body.",
"31. By making samyama on the the hollow of the throat, one stills hunger and thirst.",
"32. By making samyama on the tube within the chest, one acquires absolute motionlessness.",
"33. By making samyama on the radiance within the back of the head, one becomes able to see the celestial beings.",
"34. All these powers of knowledge may also come to one whose mind is spontaneously enlightened through purity.",
"35. By making samyama on the heart, one gains knowledge of the contents of the mind.",
"36. The power of enjoyment arises from a failure to discriminate between the Atman and the sattwa guna, which are totally different. The sattwa guna is merely the agent of the Atman, which is independent, existing only for its own sake. By making samyama on the independence of the Atman, one gains knowledge of the Atman.",
"37. Hence one gains the knowledge due to spontaneous enlightenment, and obtains supernatural powers of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell.",
"38. They are powers in the worldly state, but they are obstacles to samadhi.",
"39. When the bonds of the mind caused by karma have been loosened, the yogi can enter into the body of another by knowledge of the operation of its nerve-currents.",
"40. By controlling the nerve-currents that govern the lungs and the upper part of the body, the yogi can walk on water and swamps, or on thorns and similar objects, and he can die at will.",
"41. By controlling the force which governs the prana, he can surround himself with a blaze of light.",
"42. By making samyama on the relation between the ear and the ether, one obtains supernatural powers of hearing.",
"43. By making samyama on the relation between the body and the ether, or by acquiring through meditation the lightness of cotton fiber, the yogi can fly through the air.",
"44. By making samyama on the thought-waves of the mind when it is separated from the body -- the state known as the Great Disincarnation -- all coverings can be removed from the light of knowledge.",
"45. By making samyama on the gross and subtle forms of the elements, on their essential characteristics and the inherence of the gunas in them, and on the experiences they provide for the individual, one gains mastery of the elements.",
"46. Hence one gains the power of becoming as tiny as an atom and all similar powers; also perfection of the body, which is no longer subject to the obstructions of the elements.",
"47. Perfection of the body includes beauty, grace, strength and the hardness of a thunderbolt.",
"48. By making samyama on the transformation that sense-organs undergo when they contact objects, on the power of illumination of the sense-organs, on the ego-sense, on the gunas which constitute the organs, and on the experiences they provide for the individual, one gains mastery of the organs.",
"49. Hence the body gains the power of movement as rapid as that of the mind, the power of using the sense-organs outside the confines of the body, and the mastery of Prakriti.",
"50. By making samyama on the discrimination between the sattwa guna and the Atman, one gains omnipotence and omniscience.",
"51. By giving up even these powers, the seed of evil is destroyed and liberation follows.",
"52. When tempted by the invisible beings in high places, let the yogi feel neither allured nor flattered; for he is in danger of being caught once more by ignorance.",
"53. By making samyama on single moments and on their sequence in time, one gains discriminative knowledge.",
"54. Thus one is able to distinguish between two exactly similar objects, which cannot be distinguished by their spaces, characteristic marks, or positions in space.",
"55. This discriminative knowledge delivers a man from the bondage of ignorance. It comprehends all objects simultaneously, at every moment of their existence and in all their modifications.",
"56. Perfection is attained when the mind becomes as pure as the Atman itself.",
],[
"1. The psychic powers may be obtained either by birth, or by means of drugs, or by the power of words, or by the practice of austerities, or by concentration.",
"2. The transformation of one species into another is caused by the inflowing of nature.",
"3. Good or bad deeds are not the direct causes of the transformation. They only act as breakers of the obstacles to natural evolution; just as a farmer breaks down the obstacles in a water course, so that water flows through by its own nature.",
"4. The ego-sense alone can create minds.",
"5. Though the activities of the different created minds are various, the one original mind controls them all.",
"6. Of the various types of mind, only that which is purified by samadhi is freed from all latent impressions of karma and from all cravings.",
"7. The karma of the yogi is neither white nor black. The karma of others is of three kinds: white, black, or mixed.",
"8. Of the tendencies produced by these three kinds of karma, only those are manifested for which the conditions are favorable.",
"9. Because of our memory of past tendencies, the chain of cause and effect is not broken by change of species, space or time.",
"10. Since the desire to exist has always been present, our tendencies cannot have had any beginning.",
"11. Our subconscious tendencies depend upon cause and effect. They have their basis in the mind, and they are stimulated by the sense-objects. If all these are removed, the tendencies are destroyed.",
"12. There is the form and expression we call 'past,' and the form and expression we call 'future'; both exist within the object, at all times. Form and expression vary according to time -- past, present or future.",
"13. They are either manifest or subtle, according to the nature of the gunas.",
"14. Since the gunas work together within every change of form and expression, there is a unity in all things.",
"15. The same object is perceived in different ways by different minds. Therefore the mind must be other than object.",
"16. The object cannot be said to be dependent on the perception of a single mind. For, if this were the case, the object could be said to be non-existent when that single mind was not perceiving it.",
"17. An object is known or unknown, depending upon the moods of the mind.",
"18. Because the Atman, the Lord of the mind, is unchangeable, the mind's fluctuations are always known to it.",
"19. The mind is not self-luminous, since it is an object of perception.",
"20. And since it cannot perceive both subject and object simultaneously.",
"21. If one postulates a second mind to perceive the first, then one would have to postulate an infinite number of minds; and this would cause confusion of memory.",
"22. The pure  consciousness of the Atman is unchangeable. As the reflection of its consciousness falls upon the mind, the mind takes the form of the Atman and appears to be conscious.",
"23. The mind is able to perceive because it reflects both the Atman and the objects of perception.",
"24. Though the mind has innumerable impressions and desires, it acts only to serve another, the Atman; for being a compound substance, it cannot act independently, and for its own sake.",
"25. The man of discrimination ceases to regard the mind as the Atman.",
"26. When the mind is bent on the practice of discrimination, it moves toward liberation.",
"27. Distractions due to past impressions may arise if the mind relaxes its discrimination, even a little.",
"28. They may be overcome in the same manner as the obstacles to enlightenment.",
"29. He who remains undistracted even when he is in possession of all the psychic powers, achieves, as the result of perfect discrimination, that samadhi which is called the 'cloud of virtue.'",
"30. Thence come cessation of ignorance, the cause of suffering, and freedom from the power of karma.",
"31. Then the whole universe, with all its objects of sense-knowledge, becomes as nothing in comparison to that infinite knowledge which is free from all obstructions and impurities.",
"32. Then the sequence of mutations of the gunas comes to an end, for they have fulfilled their purpose.",
"33. This is the sequence of the mutations which take place at every moment, but which are only perceived at the end of a series.",
"34. Since the gunas no longer have any purpose to serve for the Atman, they resolve themselves into Prakriti. This is liberation. The Atman shines forth in its own pristine nature, as pure consciousness.",

"1. Here begins the authoritative instruction on Yoga.",
"2. Yoga is the ability to direct the mind exclusively toward an object and sustain that direction without any distractions.",
"3. Then the ability to understand the object fully and correctly is apparent.",
"4. The ability to understand the object is simply replaced by the mind's conception of that object or by a total lack of comprehension.",
"5. There are five activities of the mind. Each of them can be beneficial and each can cause problems.",
"6. The five activities are comprehension, misapprehension, imagination, deep sleep, and memory.",
"7. Comprehension is based on direct observation of the object, inference, and reference to reliable authorities.",
"8. Misapprehension is that comprehension that is taken to be correct until more favorable conditions reveal the actual nature of the object.",
"9. Imagination is the comprehension of an object based only on words and expressions, even though the object is absent.",
"10. Deep sleep is when the mind is overcome with heaviness and no other activities are present.",
"11. Memory is the mental retention of a conscious experience.",
"12. The mind can reach the state of Yoga through practice and detachment.",
"13. Practice is basically the correct effort required to move toward, reach, and maintain the state of Yoga.",
"14. It is only when the correct practice is followed for a long time, without interruptions and with a quality of positive attitude and eagerness, that it can succeed.",
"15. At the highest level there is an absence of any cravings, either for the fulfillment of the senses or for extraordinary experiences.",
"16. When an individual has achieved complete understanding of his true self, he will no longer be disturbed by the distracting influences within and around him.",
"17. Then the object is gradually understood fully. At first it is at a more superficial level. In time, comprehension becomes deeper. And finally it is total. There is pure joy in reaching such a depth of understanding. For then the individual is so much at one with the object that he is oblivious to his surroundings.",
"18. The usual mental disturbances are absent. However, memories of the past continue.",
"19. There will be some who are born in a state of Yoga. They need not practice or discipline themselves.",
"20. Through faith, which will give sufficient energy to achieve success against all odds, direction will be maintained. The realization of the goal of Yoga is a matter of time.",
"21. The more intense the faith and the effort, the closer the goal.",
"22. Inevitably the depth of faith varies with different individuals and at different times with the same individual. The results will reflect these variations.",
"23. Offering regular prayers to God with a feeling of submission to his power, surely enables the state of Yoga to be achieved.",
"24. God is the Supreme Being whose actions are never based on misapprehension.",
"25. He knows everything there is to be known.",
"26. God is eternal. In fact he is the ultimate teacher. He is the source of guidance for all teachers: past, present, and future.",
"27. In the way most appropriate to the qualities of God.",
"28. In order to relate to God it is necessary to regularly address him properly and reflect on his qualities.",
"29. The individual will in time perceive his true nature. He will not be disturbed by any interruptions that may arise in his journey to the state of Yoga.",
"30. There are nine types of interruptions to developing mental clarity: illness, mental stagnation, doubts, lack of foresight, fatigue, overindulgence, illusions about one's true state of mind, lack of perseverance, and regression. They are obstacles because they create mental disturbances and encourage distractions.",
"31. All these interruptions produce one or more of the following symptoms: mental discomfort, negative thinking, the inability to be at ease in different body postures, and difficulty in controlling one's breath.",
"32. If one can select an appropriate means to steady the mind and practice this, whatever the provocations, the interruptions cannot take root.",
"33. In daily life we see people around who are happier than we are, people who are less happy. Some may be doing praiseworthy things and others causing problems. Whatever may be our usual attitude toward such people and their actions, if we can be pleased with others who are happier than ourselves, compassionate toward those who are unhappy, joyful with those doing praiseworthy things, and remain undisturbed by the errors of others, our mind will be very tranquil.",
"34. The practice of breathing exercises involving extended exhalation might be helpful.",
"35. By regular inquiry into the role of the senses we can reduce mental distortions.",
"36. When we inquire into what life is and what keeps us alive, we may find some solace for our mental distractions.",
"37. When we are confronted with problems, the counsel of someone who has mastered similar problems can be a great help.",
"38. Inquiry into dreams and sleep and our experiences during or around these states can help to clarify some of our problems.",
"39. Any inquiry of interest can calm the mind.",
"40. When one reaches this state, nothing is beyond comprehension. The mind can follow and help understand the simple and the complex, the infinite and the infinitesimal, the perceptible and the imperceptible.",
"41. When the mind is free from distraction, it is possible for all the mental processes to be involved in the object of inquiry. As one remains in this state, gradually one becomes totally immersed in the object. The mind then, like a flawless diamond, reflects only the features of the object and nothing else.",
"42. Initially, because of our past experiences and ideas, our understanding of the object is distorted. Everything that has been heard, read, or felt may interfere with our perception.",
"43. When the direction of the mind toward the object is sustained, the ideas and memories of the past gradually recede. The mind becomes crystal clear and one with the object. At this moment there is no feeling of oneself. This is pure perception.",
"44. This process is possible with any type of object, at any level of perception, whether superficial and general or in-depth and specific.",
"45. Except that the mind cannot comprehend the very source of perception within us, its objects can be unlimited.",
"46. All these processes of directing the mind involve an object of inquiry.",
"47. Then the individual begins to truly know himself.",
"48. Then, what he sees and shares with others is free from error.",
"49. His knowledge is no longer based on memory of inference. It is spontaneous, direct, and at both a level and an intensity that is beyond the ordinary.",
"50. As this newly acquired quality of the mind gradually strengthens, it dominates the other mental tendencies that are based on misapprehensions.",
"51. The mind reaches a state when it has no impressions of any sort. It is open, clear, simply transparent.",
],[
"1. The practice of Yoga must reduce both physical and mental impurities. It must develop our capacity for self-examination and help us to understand that, in the final analysis, we are not the masters of everything we do.",
"2. Then such practices will be certain to remove obstacles to clear perception.",
"3. The obstacles are misapprehensions, confused values, excessive attachments, unreasonable dislikes, and insecurity.",
"4. Misapprehension is the source of all the other obstacles. They need not appear simultaneously and their impact varies. Sometimes they are obscure and barely visible; at other times they are exposed and dominant.",
"5. Misapprehension leads to errors in comprehension of the character, origin, and effects of the objects perceived.",
"6. False identity results when we regard mental activity as the very source of perception.",
"7. Excessive attachment is based on the assumption that it will contribute to everlasting happiness.",
"8. Unreasonable dislikes are usually the result of painful experiences in the past connected with particular objects and situations.",
"9. Insecurity is the inborn feeling of anxiety for what is to come. It affects both the ignorant and the wise.",
"10. When the obstacles do not seem to be present, it is important to be vigilant.",
"11. Advance toward a state of reflection to reduce their impact and prevent them from taking over.",
"12. Our actions and their consequences are influenced by these obstacles. The consequences may or may not be evident at the time of the action.",
"13. As long as the obstacles prevail they will affect action in every respect: in its execution, its duration, and its consequences.",
"14. The consequences of an action will be painful or beneficial depending on whether the obstacles were present in the concept or implementation of the action.",
"15. Painful effects from any object or situation can be a result of one or more of the following: changes in the perceived object, the desire to repeat pleasurable experiences, and the strong effect of conditioning from the past. In addition, changes within the individual can be contributing factors.",
"16. Painful effects that are likely to occur should be anticipated and avoided.",
"17. The cause of actions that produce painful effects is the inability to distinguish what is perceived from what perceives.",
"18. All that is perceived includes not only the external objects but also the mind and the senses. Theyshare three qualities: heaviness, activity, and clarity. They have two types of effects; to expose the perceiver to their influences, or to provide the means to find the distinction between them and itself.",
"19. All that is perceived is related by the common sharing of the three qualities.",
"20. That which perceives is not subject to any variations. But, it always perceives through the mind.",
"21. All that can be perceived has but one purpose: to be perceived.",
"22. The existence of all objects of perception and their appearance is independent of the needs of the individual perceiver. They exist without individual reference, to cater for the different needs of different individuals.",
"23. All that is perceived whatever it is and whatever its effect may be on a particular individual, has but one ultimate purpose. That is to clarify the distinction between the external that is seen and the internal that sees.",
"24. The absence of clarity in distinguishing between what perceives and what is perceived is due to the accumulation of misapprehension.",
"25. As misapprehension is reduced there is a corresponding increase in clarity. This is the path to freedom.",
"26. Essentially the means must be directed toward developing clarity so that the distinction between the changing qualities of what is perceived and the unchanging quality of what perceives becomes evident.",
"27. The attainment of clarity is a gradual process.",
"28. The practice and inquiry into different components of Yoga gradually reduce the obstacles such as misapprehension. Then the lamp of perception brightens and the distinction between what perceives and what is perceived becomes more and more evident. Now everything can be understood without error.",
"29. There are eight components of Yoga. These are: 1) yama, our attitudes toward our environment. 2) niyama, our attitudes toward ourselves. 3) asana, the practice of body exercises. 4) pranayama, the practice of breathing exercises. 5) pratyahara, the restraint of our senses. 6) dharana, the ability to direct our minds. 7) dhyana, the ability to develop interactions with what we seek to understand. 8) samadhi, complete integration with the object to be understood.",
"30. Yama comprises: (i) Consideration for all living things, especially those who are innocent, in difficulty, or worse off than we are.  (ii) Right communication through speech, writings, gesture, and actions. (iii) Noncovetousness or the ability to resist a desire for that which does not belong to us. (iv) Moderation in all our actions. (v) Nongreediness or the ability to accept only what is appropriate.",
"31. When the adoption of these attitudes in our environmental is beyond compromise, regardless of our social, cultural, intellectual or individual station, it approaches irreversibility.",
"32. Niyama comprises: (i) Cleanliness, or keeping our bodies and our surroundings clean and neat.  (ii) Contentment, or the ability to be comfortable with what we have and what we do not have.  (iii) The removal of impurities in our physical and mental systems through the maintenance of such correct habits as sleep, exercise, nutrition, work, and relaxation.  (iv) Study and the necessity to review and evaluate our progress.  (v) Reverence to a higher intelligence or the acceptance of our limitations in relation to God, the all-knowing.",
"33. When these attitudes are questioned, self-reflection on the possible consequences of alternativeattitudes may help.",
"34. For example, a sudden desire to act harshly, or encourage or approve of harsh actions can be contained by reflecting on the harmful consequences. Often such actions are the results of lower instincts such as anger, possessiveness, or unsound judgment. Whether these actions are minor or major, reflection in a suitable atmosphere can contain our desires to act in this way.",
"35. The more considerate one is, the more one stimulates friendly feelings among all in one's presence.",
"36. One who shows a high degree of right communication will not fail in his actions.",
"37. One who is trustworthy, because he does not covet what belongs to others, naturally has everyone's confidence and everything is shared with him, however precious it might be.",
"38. At its best, moderation produces the highest individual quality.",
"39. One who is not greedy is secure. He has time to think deeply. His understanding of himself is complete.",
"40. When cleanliness is developed it reveals what needs to be constantly maintained and what is eternally clean. What decays is the external. What does not is deep within us.",
"41. In addition one becomes able to reflect on the very deep nature of our individual selves, including the source of perception, without being distracted by the senses and with freedom from misapprehension accumulated from the past.",
"42. The result of contentment is total happiness.",
"43. The removal of impurities allows the body to function more efficiently.",
"44. Study, when it is developed to the highest degree, brings one close to higher forces that promote understanding of the most complex.",
"45. Reverence to God promotes the ability to completely understand any object of choice.",
"46. Asana must have the dual qualities of alertness and relaxation.",
"47. These qualities can be achieved by recognizing and observing the reactions of the body and the breath to the various postures that comprise asana practice. Once known, these reactions can be controlled step-by-step.",
"48. When these principles are correctly followed, asana practice will help a person endure and even minimize the external influences on the body such as age, climate, diet, and work.",
"49. Pranayama is the conscious, deliberate regulation of the breath replacing unconscious patterns of breathing. It is possible only after a reasonable mastery of asana practice.",
"50. It involves the regulation of the exhalation, the inhalation, and the suspension of the breath. The regulation of these three processes is achieved by modulating their length and maintaining this modulation for a period of time, as well as directing the mind into the process. These components of breathing must be both long and uniform.",
"51. Then the breath transcends the level of the consciousness.",
"52. The regular practice of pranayama reduces the obstacles that inhibit clear perception.",
"53. And the mind is now prepared for the process of direction toward a chosen goal.",
"54. The restraint of senses occurs when the mind is able to remain in its chosen direction and the senses disregard the different objects around them and faithfully follow the direction of the mind.",
"55. Then the senses are mastered.",
],[
"1. The mind has reached the ability to be directed [dharana] when direction toward a chosen object is possible in spite of many other potential objects within the reach of the individual.",
"2. Then the mental activities form an uninterrupted flow only in relation to this object.",
"3. Soon the individual is so much involved in the object that nothing except its comprehension is evident. It is as if the individual has lost his own identity. This is the complete integration with the object of understanding [samadhi].",
"4. When these processes are continuously and exclusively applied to the same object it is called samyama.",
"5. Samyama on a chosen object leads to a comprehensive knowledge of the object in all its aspects.",
"6. Samyama must be developed gradually.",
"7. Compared to the first five components of Yoga [sutra 2.29] the next three [sutras 3.1, 2, 3] are more intricate.",
"8. The state where the mind has no impressions of any sort and nothing is beyond its reach [nirbijah samadhi] is more intricate than the state of directing the mind towards an object [samadhi].",
"9. The mind is capable of having two states based on two distinct tendencies. These are distraction and attention. At any one moment, however, only one state prevails, and this state influences the individual's behavior, attitudes, and expressions.",
"10. By constant and uninterrupted practice the mind can remain in a state of attention for a long time.",
"11. The mind alternates between the possibility of intense concentration and a state where alternative objects can attract attention.",
"12. The mind reaches a stage where the link with the object is consistent and continuous. The distractions cease to appear.",
"13. As it has been established that the mind has different states [corresponding to which there arose different attitudes, possibilities, and behavior patterns in the individual] it can also be said that such changes can occur in all the objects of perception and in the senses. These changes can be at different levels and influenced by external forces such as time or our intelligence.",
"14. A substance contains all its characteristics and, depending on the particular form it takes, those characteristics conforming to that form will be apparent. But whatever the form, whatever the characteristics exhibited, there exists a base that comprises all characteristics. Some have appeared in the past, some are currently apparent, and others may reveal themselves in the future.",
"15. By changing the order or sequence of change, characteristics that are of one pattern can be modified to a different pattern",
"16. Samyama on the process of change, how it can be affected by time and other factors, develops knowledge of the past and the future.",
"17. Samyama on the interactions between language, ideas, and object is to examine the individual features of the objects, the means of describing them, and the ideas and their cultural influences in the minds of the describers. Through this, one can find the most accurate and effective way of communicating regardless of linguistic, cultural, and other barriers.",
"18. Samyama on one's tendencies and habits will lead one to their origins. Consequently one gains deep knowledge of one's past.",
"19. Samyama on the changes that arise in an individual's mind and their consequences develops in one the ability to acutely observe the state of mind of others.",
"20. No. The cause of the state of mind of one individual is beyond the scope of observation by another.",
"21. Samyama on the relationship between the features of the body and what affects them can give one the means to merge with one's surroundings in such a way that one's form is indistinguishable.",
"22. -- This verse is missing in Desikachar's commentary (pata bheda) --",
"23. The results of actions may be immediate or delayed. Samyama on this can give one the ability to predict the course of future actions and even his own death.",
"24. Different qualities such as friendliness, compassion, and contentment can be inquired into through samyama. Thus, one can learn how to strengthen a chosen quality.",
"25. Samyama on the physical strength of an elephant can give one the strength of an elephant",
"26. Directing the mind to the life-force itself and sustaining that direction through samyama, results in the ability to observe fine subtleties and understand what is preventing deep observation.",
"27. Samyama on the sun gives wide knowledge of the planetary system and the cosmic regions.",
"28. Samyama on the moon gives a thorough knowledge of the position of the stars at different times.",
"29. Samyama on Polaris gives knowledge about the relative movements of the stars.",
"30. Samyama on the navel gives knowledge about the different organs of the body and their dispositions.",
"31. Using the throat as a point of inquiry for samyama provides an understanding of thirst and hunger. This enables one to control their extreme symptoms.",
"32. Samyama on the chest area and inquiry into the sensations felt there in different physical and mental states gives one the means to remain stable and calm even in very stressful situations.",
"33. Samyama on the source of high intelligence in an individual develops supernormal capabilities.",
"34. Anything can be understood. With each attempt fresh and spontaneous understanding arises.",
"35. Samyama on the heart will definitely reveal the qualities of the mind.",
"36. The mind, which is subject to change, and the Perceiver, which is not, are in proximity but are of distinct and different characters. When the mind is directed externally and acts mechanically toward objects there is either pleasure or pain. When at the appropriate time, however, an individual begins inquiry into the very nature of the link between the Perceiver and perception the mind is disconnected from external objects and there arises the understanding of the Perceiver itself.",
"37. Then one begins to acquire extraordinary capacities for perception.",
"38. For an individual who may revert to a state of distraction, this extraordinary knowledge and the capabilities acquired through samyama are worth possessing. But for one who seeks nothing less than a sustained state of Yoga the results of samyama are obstacles in themselves.",
"39. By inquiring into the cause of this rigid situation binding the mind to the individual and examining the means of relaxing this rigidity there is great potential for an individual to reach beyond the confines of himself.",
"40. By mastering the forces that transmit sensations from the body to the mind it is possible to master the external stimuli. For instance, one can tolerate water of any temperature or the effects of thorns or one can walk on unstable surfaces and even feel as light as a balloon.",
"41. By mastering samana one can experience sensations of excessive heat.",
"42. Samyama on the relationship between the sense of hearing and space develops an extraordinary sense of hearing.",
"43. By samyama on the relationship between the body and space, and examining the properties of objects that can float such as cotton fluff, the knowledge to move about in space can be achieved.",
"44. By examining these phenomena and developing conditions when the mind does not confuse perception, there arises an extraordinary faculty with which one can probe other minds. In addition the clouds that obscure correct perception are minimized.",
"45. Samyama on the origin of matter in all its forms, appearances, and uses can develop into mastery of the elements.",
"46. When the elements are mastered one is no longer disturbed by them. The body reaches perfection and extraordinary capabilities become possible.",
"47. Perfection in the body means good features, attractiveness to others, physical firmness, and unusual physical strength.",
"48. Mastery over the senses is achieved through samyama on the ability of the senses to observe their respective objects, how such objects are understood, how the individual identifies with the object, how the object, the senses, the mind, and the Perceiver are interrelated, and what results from such perception.",
"49. Then the response of the senses will be as swift as that of the mind. They will perceive acutely and the individual will have the capacity to influence the characteristics of the elements.",
"50. When there is clear understanding of the difference between the Perceiver and the mind, all the various states of mind and what affects them become known. Then, the mind becomes a perfect instrument for the flawless perception of everything that need be known.",
"51. Freedom, the last goal of Yoga, is attained only when the desire to acquire extraordinary knowledge is rejected and the source of obstacles is completely controlled.",
"52. The temptation to accept the respectful status as a consequence of acquiring knowledge through samyama should be restrained. Otherwise, one is led to the same unpleasant consequences that arise from all obstacles to Yoga.",
"53. Samyama on time and its sequence brings about absolute clarity.",
"54. This clarity makes it possible to distinguish objects even when the distinction is not apparently clear. Apparent similarity should not deter one from the distinct perception of a chosen object.",
"55. Such clarity is not exclusive of any object, any particular situation, or any moment. It is not the result of sequential logic. It is immediate, spontaneous, and total.",
"56. Freedom is when the mind has complete identity with the Perceiver.",
],[
"1. Exceptional mental capabilities may be achieved by: genetic inheritance, the use of herbs as prescribed in the Vedas, reciting incantations, rigorous austerities, and through that state of mind that remains with its object without distractions [samadhi].",
"2. Change from one set of characteristics to another is essentially an adjustment of the basic qualities of matter.",
"3. But such intelligence can only remove obstacles that obstruct certain changes. Its role is no more than that of a farmer who cuts a dam to allow water to flow into the field where it is needed.",
"4. With exceptional mental faculties an individual can influence the mental state of other beings.",
"5. This influence also depends on the state of the recipient.",
"6. Influence on another by one whose mind is in a state of dhyana can never increase anxiety or other obstacles. In fact, they are reduced.",
"7. And they act without any motivation while others who also have exceptional capabilities act with some motivation or other.",
"8. Because the tendency of the mind to act on the basis of the five obstacles, such as misapprehension, has not been erased, they will surface in the future to produce their unpleasant consequences.",
"9. Memory and latent impressions are strongly linked. This link remains even if there is an interval of time, place, or context between similar actions.",
"10. There is a strong desire for immortality in all men at all times. Thus these impressions cannot be ascribed to any time.",
"11. These tendencies are both maintained and sustained by misapprehensions, external stimuli, attachment to the fruits of actions, and the quality of mind that promotes hyperactivity. Reduction of these automatically makes the undesirable impressions ineffective.",
"12. The substance of what has disappeared as well as what may appear always exists. Whether or not they are evident depends upon the direction of change.",
"13. Whether or not particular characteristics appear depends on the mutations of the three qualities.",
"14. The characteristics of a substance at one moment in time is in fact a single change in these qualities.",
"15. The characteristics of an object appear differently, depending upon the different mental states of the observer.",
"16. If the object were indeed the conception of a particular individual's mind, then in the absence of his perception, would it exist?",
"17. Whether an object is perceived or not depends on its accessibility as well as the individual's motivation.",
"18. Mental activities are always known to the Perceiver that is nonchanging and master of the mind.",
"19. In addition, the mind is a part of what is perceived and has no power of its own to perceive. ",
"20. The premise that the mind can play two roles is untenable because it cannot simultaneously fabricate and see what it fabricates.",
"21. In an individual with such a series of minds of momentary existence there would be disorder and the difficulty of maintaining consistency of memory.",
"22. When the mind is not linked to external objects and it does not respect an external form to the Perceiver, then it takes the form of the Perceiver itself.",
"23. Thus the mind serves a dual purpose. It serves the Perceiver by presenting the external to it. It also repects [sic] or presents the Perceiver to itself for its own enlightenment.",
"24. Even though the mind has accumulated various impressions of different types it is always at the disposal of the Perceiver. This is because the mind cannot function without the power of the Perceiver.",
"25. A person of extraordinary clarity is one who is free from the desire to know the nature of the Perceiver.",
"26. And their clarity takes them to their only concern; to reach and remain in a state of freedom.",
"27. In the unlikely possibility of distraction from this aim, disturbing past impressions are able to surface.",
"28. One must never accommodate even small errors because they are as detrimental as the five obstacles.",
"29. There arises a state of mind full of clarity concerning all things at all times. It is like a rainfall of pure clarity.",
"30. This is, indeed, the state free from actions based on the five obstacles.",
"31. When the mind is free from the clouds that prevent perception, all is known, there is nothing to be known.",
"32. The three basic qualities cease to follow the sequence of alternating pain and pleasure.",
"33. A sequence is the replacement of one characteristic by one that follows it. This is linked to moment. A replacement of characteristics is also the basis of moment.",
"34. When the highest purpose of life is achieved the three basic qualities do not excite responses in the mind. That is freedom. In other words, the Perceiver is no longer colored by the mind.",

"1. Now, when a sincere seeker approaches an enlightened teacher, with the right attitude of discipleship (viz., free of preconceived notions and prejudices, and full of intelligent faith and receptivity) and with the right spirit of enquiry, at the right time and the right place, communication of yoga takes place.",
"2. Yoga happens when there is stilling (in the sense of continual and vigilant watchfulness) of the movement of thought without expression or suppression in the indivisible intelligence in which there is no movement.",
"3. In the light of non-volitional, non-moving and therefore spontaneous and choiceless awareness the undivided intelligence with its apparent and passing modifications or movements of thought within itself is not confused with nor confined to any of these. Then (when yoga thus happens), the seer or the homogeneous intelligence which is ignorantly regarded as the separate experiencer of sensations and emotions, and the separate performer of actions, is not split up into one or the other of the states or modifications of the mind, and exists by itself and as itself.",
"4. At other times, when yoga does not happen and when the mind is busily occupied with the movement, there is a cloud of confusion in the undivided, homogeneous intelligence. In the shadow of that cloud, there arises false identification or cognition of the movement of the mind-fragment and hence distorted understanding. The single concept or idea or the single movement of thought is mistaken as the totality.",
"5. These apparent movements or states or moods of the mind, which are concepts, ideas or images in it, can all be grouped under five categories, irrespective of whether they are experienced as painful or non-painful, and whether or not they are covertly or clearly tainted by the five-fold afflictions described later.",
"6. These five categories of apparent movements of the mind are: (1) proven theory, which is often assumed to have been reliably proved and therefore to constitute right knowledge; (or, rationalisation of the movement of thought); (2) unsound thinking or wrong knowledge, assumptions, presumptions, beliefs (deductions and inference may also be included here); (or, verbal condemnation of the movement of thought as wrong); (3) fancy or hallucination or imagination totally unrelated to any proven or assumed theories, which may also include the delusion that one is already out of the movement of thought; (4) a state of dullness or sleep; (or, succumbing to the movement of thought, feeling it is impossible to go beyond it); (5) memory, or the recollection of a teaching or an experience which gives rise to the notion that it is possible to go beyond the movement of thought; such a notion forms an image.",
"7. What are proven theories? Theories are said to derive their proof from one or the other of the following sources: (1) direct perception, sense-experience, or intuition; (2) deduction or extension of direct perception and sense-experience or beliefs: in the absence of direct proof or experience, indirect proof is deduced from the right or wrong application of principles of logic chosen by oneself, which often lead to vague generalisations or presumptions that since the theory comes from a usually reliable source, it must be correct. (3) scriptural or other trustworthy testimony or authority where, again, one accepts as proof the statements of those whom one has accepted as THE authority, such acceptance being blind and fanatic.",
"8. Unsound thinking or wrong knowledge is based on error, on mistaken identity, where the cognition is unreal and faulty and hence the knowledge is faulty, too, and where there is no agreement between the expression and the experience, between the substance and the description.",
"9. Fanciful or hallucinatory expressions and even experiences or imaginations are sound without substance, empty words and phrases or descriptions which have no corresponding reality, however realistic or inspiring or satisfying they may appear to be: hence they are the most deceptive and least trustworthy.",
"10. When nothingness or void is the content of the mind, when the idea of nothingness alone prevails, or when the mind thinks that it does not think at all, there is sleep, which is a state of mental or psychic inertia.",
"11. Memory is the non-abandonment of the impression created by past experiences, which is revived with much the same impact on the mind-stuff as at the time of the original experience, but with or without the original details and emotional response.",
"12. The right understanding and the realisation of the real nature of these five categories of mental states, is gained by (1) right exertion, and (2) the simultaneous, effortless and wise avoidance of the distracting influences. The latter includes the non-arousal of cravings and attractions that compound one's confusion, and the steady perception in the inner light that the mistaking of the mental states for the undivided intelligence, is both the cause and the effect of the clouding of the light. Such perception is sufficiently strong and wise to know that the intelligence is forever uncoloured by ignorant waywardness.",
"13. Any steady and continuous or persistent and vigilant endeavour to stand firm in the understanding of the truth of the indivisibility of cosmic intelligence is known as spiritual practice (right exertion).",
"14. But, when is one said to be well grounded in practice? When this spontaneous awareness or cosmic consciousness continues without interruption, for a long time, and one is devoted to it with all one's being, in all sincerity and earnestness.",
"15. How does one avoid distracting influences, without being distracted by such effort? When the consciousness functions in a masterly way so that the compulsive and overpowering craving for objects seen or heard of, is skillfully (that is, without suppression or expression, inhibition or indulgence) turned upon itself there arises an intense and consuming quest in quest of the what, how and where of the craving itself: that is known as uncolouredness or dispassion.",
"16. Whereas in the earlier stages of yoga-practice, this turning craving upon itself may be (i) blind suppression, or (ii) an act of self-sacrifice with a reward in view, or (iii) at best an active expression of unquestioning faith in accepted authority the spiritual quest transcends such qualified self-discipline, when THAT which is beyond the conditioned and therefore fragmented inner personality is directly seen to be free of all craving.",
"17. The realisation of the unconditioned being is at times associated with logical reasoning or examination, deep a-rational enquiry, an experience of bliss or of pure I-am-ness. Yet even at those times there is consciousness of the subject-object relationship, and knowledge of the physiological and psychological states, experiences and deeds.",
"18. Different from this is the practice which is based on cessation of all effort even at meditating: this practice leads spontaneously to tranquillity. In that, only the impressions or memories remain: of such impressions is the me constituted.",
"19. When such impressions remain, one retains the possibility (and the cause) of birth, even after being freed from the present body and after becoming integrated with one's own or the cosmic nature. For, such impressions or memories nurture and perpetuate the awareness of continued personal existence.",
"20. In the case of others, when such spontaneous realisation of the unconditioned does not happen, such realisation is preceded by and proceeds from faith or one-pointed devotion, great energy and use of will-power, constant remembrance of teachings and one's own experience, the practice of samadhi (the state of inner harmony), and a knowledge or discernment of such harmony all of which lead one gradually on to that state of yoga.",
"21. However, lest it should be misconstrued that such gradual evolution implies cosmological or psychological distance to be covered, it should be added that the state of yoga or the unconditioned intelligence is close at hand irrespective of the approach followed by the seekers if they are full of intense zeal, enthusiasm, energy and sincerity, and are thus able speedily to overcome obstacles.",
"22. Yet, again, it is possible to see a distinction between mild, middling and intense zeal, energy and effort, although yoga (which is spontaneous realisation of oneness) and effort (which implies duality) are contradiction in terms.",
"23. Or, the state of yoga is attained by complete, instant, dynamic, energetic and vigilant surrender of the ego-principle to the omnipresent ever-existent reality or god. This is instant realisation of God as the only reality, when the (ego's?) quest of self-knowledge meets its counterpart, ignorance, and stands bewildered in choiceless encounter, and when the ego-ignorance phantom instantly collapses.",
"24. Who is god? That unique indwelling omnipresence that is never tainted nor touched by the ground of actions and their reactions, which afflict ignorant individuals; that which is left-over after the ego-ignorance-collapse; that special inner ruler or intelligence which is unconditioned by time and whose will alone prevails even in the body. In it there is oneness, never divided. It is therefore beyond ignorance and its progeny.",
"25. In that (god or surrender to god) there is the source of the highest and most excellent omniscience, for the self-limitation which is ignorance is dispelled by the removal of the ego-ignorance obstacle; (Or, the omniscience in that is natural and arouses no wonder).",
"26. That omnipresent reality, both in its manifest and in its unmanifest aspects, is the source of inspiration and intuitive enlightening experience of all the sages from beginingless time: for it is not conditioned (or divided) by time. The inner light is timeless. The enlightening experience is timeless, for, time is thought and thought is ignorance.",
"27. That indwelling omnipresent sole reality is verbally alluded to as OM, which is the evernew and eternal cosmic sound that is heard in all natural phenomena (thunderclap, roaring of the ocean, wind rustling trees in the forest, and the conflagration) and even in the reverberations of the musical instruments, the hum of engines, and the distant din of the carnival crowd.",
"28. How to utilise that OM in the adoration of god? By repeating it, at the same time, enquiring into, contemplating and saturating the whole being with, the substance indicated by it that is, the reality or god, which is the real meaning of OM.",
"29. When one repeats the OM in this manner, then the consciousness which is ordinarily scattered over the diversity, is gathered, concentrated and turned inward. The spirit of enquiry into the substance of the OM dispels all the obstacles or distractions without necessarily wrestling or struggling with them.",
"30. What are the obstacles? (1) Disease, (2) dullness, (3) doubt, (4) carelessness, (5) laziness, (6) inability to turn the attention away (from the obstacles), (7) perverted or distorted vision, (8) inability to find a firm ground for the spiritual investigation, and (9) even when such a ground is found, unsteadiness of mind and attention in the pursuit of the enquiry these are the obstacles and distractions, for they bring about and constitute the apparent fragmentation of the mind-stuff.",
"31. By the presence of the following symptoms can be understood the extent to which the mind is disturbed and distracted: (1) sorrowful mood, (2) psychological despair, (3) the motions of the body, and (4) inhalation and exhalation. By being attentive to these factors, it is possible to arrive at an understanding of the degree of seriousness of the obstacles: for they co-exist with the distractions of the mind.",
"32. In order to overcome mental distractions one should steadily adhere to the practice of one method. Whereas any method will help one overcome distractions, frequent change of the methods adopted in one's practice will aggravate the distractions; (several suggested methods follow).",
"33. The following fourfold attitude to life's vicissitudes and in all relationships, being conducive to peace of mind, enables one to overcome the distractions of the mind: (1) friendliness towards pleasure or those who are pleasantly disposed to oneself (friends), (2) compassion for the sorrowful, and when one is in a painful condition, self-forgetful sympathy for those who may be in a similar painful condition, (3) rejoicing in the exaltation of the noble or the holy ones, and (4) indifference to unholiness, not being drawn into it nor holding others in contempt for their unholiness.",
"34. Or, the distractions can be overcome by literally and physically exhaling the breath and holding the lungs empty, or by adopting such other methods like fasting or contemplation of death, etc., by which one symbolically expires and holds the prana or life-force outside, as it were.",
"35. Or, intense and vigilant attentiveness to the activities aroused within oneself by senseexperiences can also act as a binding force to prevent mental distractions. Needless to say that one should not get lost in such sense-experiences. Of such is attentiveness to breathing or to the movement of life-force, or to the silent sound of a mantra mentally uttered, to the subtle vision of the divine presence, or to the experience of the space of consciousness within the heart.",
"36. Or, one may be keenly attentive to an internal (the psychic blissful inner light) or an external person or phenomenon devoid of sorrow and full of resplendence, and thus overcome distractions of the mind-stuff.",
"37. Or, the mental distractions can be eliminated by the adoration of the consciousness of one or which is free from conditioning (or the psychological colouring of attachment or passion). To this category belong even divine images, celestial bodies like the sun, and enlightened living beings or even babies though surely one should constantly bear in mind that it is their unconditioned nature which entitles them to be thus adored.",
"38. Or, the distractions can be removed by holding on to the wisdom gained in dreams, whether they are parapsychological visions or symbolical dreams, as also the wisdom gained by a profound reflection on the message of deep sleep, in which there is total absence of mental distraction, and in which one experiences no diversity at all. In this state, free from obstacles, one experiences peace and happiness which are recollected on awaking from sleep.",
"39. Or, the distractions can be overcome by adopting any contemplative technique, using any object of meditation, one likes most, for that which one likes most holds one's attention, and the technique one likes most makes contemplation easy provided, of course, that neither the object nor the technique itself involves or invites distraction.",
"40. The mind or the intelligence thus freed from distractions encompasses or comprehends the smallest as also the greatest for it is free from all limitations, from all conditioning, and from all colouring, and is therefore like the purest crystal.",
"41. Lest it should be misunderstood that the intelligence freed from conditioning and colouring is dull, inactive, unresponsive and void, it should be remembered that, like a pure crystal which reflects without distortion or confusion any object that is placed near it, the steady and ever-alert intelligence, too, receives and reflects the colour (nature) of the subject, the predicate, and the object in all situations, instantly, spontaneously and appropriately.",
"42. In the case of the understanding reached through logic or reasoning, there is confusion on account of the discrepancies that exist between the word (description), meaning (in both connotations as the substance described and as the knowledge of the wordmeaning) and imagination or assumption. Hence, it is unclear and uncertain.",
"43. But, when the mind-stuff is cleansed of memory, the self or personality which was nothing but the fragmentation, the conditioning or the colouring (the impurity) is wiped out as it were; and the substance or truth alone shines, without distortion, logic or reasoning which is the function of the limited personality.",
"44. Whatever has been said above also applies to similar distinctions between the other methods already suggested (like the method of enquiry) and spontaneous awareness. Thus, by this they and all the subtleties involved have been explained, leaving only the subtlest experiencer of awareness to be dealt with.",
"45. When thus the subtle experiencer of the inner awareness is observed without interruption one arrives at that which has no identification or distinguishing mark, but which is at the same time not a void.",
"46. That indeed is the realisation of the homogeneous cosmic essence, though even in it there exists the seed of potential fragmentation, which is the consciousness of the individuality or the observer.",
"47. Proficiency in such observation dispenses with even self-enquiry, on account of the uninterrupted self-awareness being natural: then there is spiritual enlightenment, peace and bliss.",
"48. Such enlightenment is saturated with harmony, order and righteousness.",
"49. This enlightenment, this understanding, this realisation is quite different from what one has heard about or deduced from teaching obtained from external sources. Whereas in the case of the latter the object of study, investigation and understanding is outside of the consciousness, the realisation arrived at in the former is of a special category.",
"50. This special realisation of spontaneous self-awareness completely transmutes the entire being and there is total change. All other habits and tendencies are overcome by habitual self-awareness.",
"51. When even that special realisation (with the seed of fragmentation still present) is transcended, everything is transcended, and the seeker has, as it were, come one full circle. The Reality realises itself (it is) without the need for the individual even in his subtlest state. This indeed is the enlightenment in which there is no seed at all for the manifestation of diversity."
],[
"1. The kindling of the inner psychic fire that at once burns away all the impurities (colouring) and limitations of the mind-stuff, the study both of scriptural texts and one's own reaction to situations from moment to moment, and the meaningful, dynamic and devotional surrender to the indwelling omnipresence these three simultaneously constitute active yoga, or practice of the indivisible unity.",
"2. When it is clearly understood that the instant realisation of cosmic oneness which is yoga is not the product of any effort, how can one practise such unity? Surely, active yoga is taught not because such practice results in the realisation of oneness. However, it can aid in the direction of one's attention towards enlightenment, and away from the elements that cause mental turmoil, which, as a result of such turning away, are weakened.",
"3. The mind is restless because of the many unresolved problems. The elements that disturb mental equilibrium and thus generate psychic distress are: (1) ignorance of the truth concerning (2) one's self or egotism which seems to be the obvious truth in ignorance, and the belief in the separative individuality, (3&4) psychological and unnatural extension of attraction and repulsion which, as neurological phenomena are natural, and (5) blind clinging to the present physical life, born of the ignorant division of timeless eternity into life and death.",
"4. Obviously, ignorance of the truth of oneness (or indivisibility of cosmic intelligence) is the cause of all the other sources of psychic distress whether these latter seem to be completely hidden or dormant, veiled or weak, or actively spread out, creating the notion that they are not related to spiritual ignorance, that they are independent of ignorance, and can, therefore, be dealt with by means other than self-knowledge.",
"5. Ignorance gives rise to a knowledge of ego-sense an assumed fact of the non-existent ego-sense. It is only in a state of spiritual ignorance that one identifies or confuses that which is impermanent with that which is eternal, that which is impure or coloured with that which is pure and unconditioned, pain with joy, and the unmodified consciousness (Self) with thoughts and modifications which are not-Self. Realisation of the spiritual truth or enlightenment on the other hand enables the impermanent, etc., to be seen as such, and the permanent, etc., to be seen as such.",
"6. In cosmic consciousness all activities happen. Thus, for instance, seeing happens: the power of sight sees. However, when the consciousness fragmented by the shadow of ignorance identifies itself as the seer, there is the ego-sense.",
"7. Attraction (or mental conditioning or colouring) follows, rests in, and is just another term for, the erroneous evaluation of an object or experience as pleasure. Because of the mental colouring something looks attractive.",
"8. Similarly, repulsion (which is another phase of attraction) follows, abides in, and is just another term for, the erroneous classification of an object or experience as pain-giving. On the other hand, what the human mind in ignorance regards as attraction and repulsion exist in nature and are inherent, invariable and constant in the manifestation of cosmic intelligence (e.g., the magnetic polarity). In nature, however, there is neither the cloud of ignorance nor its consequent ego-sense, and hence the attraction and repulsion in nature are of an entirely different quality to that found in the human psyche.",
"9 Blind clinging to life is an inexplicable yet undeniable fact of life which is self-sustaining (since it is just another phase or face of ignorance) and is therefore found to be a dominant factor even in wise beings as long as the physical body which is the operative seat of ignorance exists. It is the operation of the power that preserves the physical sheath for the unfoldment of self-knowledge, combined with the habit of dependence on objective sources for enjoyment and sustenance and fear of losing them, and the inability to see other states of existence.",
"10. These sources of psychic distress are subtle, and not to be confused with their gross expansion as likes and dislikes, habits (good and bad), vanity and such personality traits. However, these subtle sources of psychic distress can be dispelled by resolving each in its own cause (or by confronting each of them with its own true opposite).",
"11. Both when these elements of psychic distress are mere ripples on the surface of the mind-stuff and when they become gross and operative, they can be dispelled by contemplation.",
"12. All actions bear to the five-fold psychic disturbance or distress a mutual cause-andeffect relationship, thus sustaining a chain reaction. Hence, actions lead to afflictions (notions of ego-sense) which manifest in the obvious physical life as experience of pleasure, pain, etc., and also in the subtle mental states (likes and dislikes), here in this life-span or in other not so obvious life-states and such afflictions (the ego-sense and ignorance) generate further actions. However, this need not for ever be so; for from these effects the causes can be known, and the root-cause made inoperative.",
"13. As long as the roots of these psychic disturbances exist generating their consequent actions, their expansion and fruition are inevitable. Their fruition takes place in different life-spans, perhaps in different species, and in diverse experiences. Such fruition is therefore an unmistakable pointer to the persistence of spiritual ignorance and its offsprings which are the fountain-source of sorrow.",
"14. These experiences which are the results of virtue and vice are the sweet and bitter fruits (causing happiness and agony respectively) that are found all along the path of life.",
"15. However, the wise (though their own mind is totally free of all sorrow) consider all experiences painful as they are all the fruits of the actions of ignorance. The very pleasures are accompanied by the painful realisation that they are subject to change. Constant and violently painful craving for repetitive experience of pleasure in a vain attempt to cancel the change fills the interval with pain. All of this leaves an enduring impression on the mind, which (impression) creates the painful tendency to crave for the avoidance of pain which alone is therefore continuous. And, there is constant conflict in oneself as the psychological mood changes, with every change in the thoughtform in the mind-stuff; and the conflict is sorrow.",
"16. Yet, all is not lost. For, sorrow that has not yet arrived, not yet reached the field of experience, can be avoided; unhappiness that has not yet befallen may be avoided, by avoiding psychic contact with it.",
"17. How to avoid contact with the experience of pain? By understanding the structure of this experience. What is the structure of experience? The division or the polarisation of experiencing into the experiencer and the experience, and the subsequent conjunction or contact of the subject and the object of the experiencing and this can be avoided. Experiencing being the sole reality, the subject and the object are of identical nature, and thought is the dividing agent. Thought is of pain, pleasure, etc.; and thought experiences pain, pleasure, etc., by the psychological action of division and contact. The possibility of the avoidance of pain is because of the unity of the seer (experiencer) and the seen (experience) without a division.",
"18. What is the object and how does it come into being? The object of the experiencing is threefold in nature (1) the light of intelligence, (2) dynamic activity, and (3) material existence. While the external cosmos is the object of the senses, they themselves are regarded as the object of experiencing by the ignorant, both the external cosmos and the internal experiencer being indivisible from the experiencing. Yet, the object helps the intelligence to realise its true nature by intelligent experiencing, and thus be freed from ignorance.",
"19. Such objects may even be of different kinds or categories: (1) they can be special supernatural experiences, (2) they can be commonplace and routine experiences, (3) they may have distinguishing marks or characteristics, or (4) they may be subtle, without any distinguishing marks: and their qualities may be in different stages of development. Simply, the entire cosmos including the external world and the internal sensory system, is the object.",
"20 The truth concerning the seer (experiencer) is that there is only the ever-pure act of seeing (experiencing). Yet, there arises a polarisation on account of which a concept (which then becomes the subject or the experiencer) seems to experience (the reaction of the senses to the externalised world all such externalisation being the result of the polarisation and the consequent apparent movement in the subject). An apparently independent entity called experience therefore becomes the object.",
"21. The existence or the very meaning of the object is but the sum and substance of the subject's fragmentary experience, brought on by the ignorant polarisation. This fragmentary experience is the contact with pain.",
"22. To him who has attained fulfillment, when the (un)real nature of the polarisation of experiencing is truly understood, the contact with pain ceases: the only way to avoid pain is never to be separated from it (as the experiencer)! Yet, the potentiality of polarisation (separation) and the consequent contact with pain exist in other, ordinary circumstances. Hence, even an enlightened person may still experience pain when not in the total awareness of non-separation.",
"23. When the polarisation of the experiencing has taken place, the subject's desire for awareness of its own nature and its own voluntary and involuntary powers of action causes or acts as a link or contact between the subject and the object. (Here, the subject is the fragmented concept of self, and the object is both the sense-experience and the external sense-object).",
"24. Obviously, all this is due to the ignorance of the spiritual truth or oneness. Ignorance alone is the cause for the polarisation, the fictitious separation which is the sole cause for the desire to become aware of another and for the contact of the other.",
"25. When that ignorance is dispelled, the polarisation (separation, division or fragmentation) and the consequent conjunction or contact of the experiencer and the experience is rendered meaningless. It is given up. This is liberation for the seer who is pure experiencing or the undivided homogeneous consciousness which alone existed. Liberation is not isolation nor independence from another, but union in the sense of non-division.",
"26. Briefly, the constant unbroken awareness of this truth alone is the means to the ending of this ignorance and its retinue.",
"27. This awareness is keen, intense and operative even in the field of the first seven of the eight states or limbs of yoga-practice whose description follows: This practice should therefore not be a mechanical, unintelligent, dull routine.",
"28. This awareness shines resplendent with the light of intelligence, when the inner psychic impurities that becloud the vision of truth have been eliminated by the intelligent practice of the limbs of yoga.",
"29. Discipline, observances, posture, exercise of the life-force, introversion of attention, concentration, meditation and illumination (at-one-ment) are the eight limbs of yoga or the direct realisation of oneness. Hence, these limbs should all be practised together, intelligently, so that the impurities of all the physical, vital and psychological limbs may be eliminated.",
"30. When the light of intelligence or the awareness of the truth illumines the mind-stuff, psychological order comes to prevail which is manifest as the following articles of natural self-restraint or discipline: non-violence, perception of what is or truth, nonhoarding, an effortless movement of the total being in cosmic homogeneous essence, and non-covetousness. (The fourth article also specifically refers to continence or chastity.)",
"31. These articles of supreme (because effortless) self-restraint or order are universally invariable in everyone seeking enlightenment. They are compromised only when there is disharmony and contradiction between, for example, one's head which seeks the order and one's heart which seeks the concomitant of disorder, viz., pleasure. They are not affected or modified by distinctions of birth (class, tribal, etc.) nationality or geography, epoch (ancient, modern, etc.) or of circumstances (profession, life-style, contingencies, etc.).",
"32. In the light of intelligence illumining the life-style, arise the following observances: purity of body, mind and environment, contentment, psychic fire that simplifies life and purifies the heart, self-study or constant vigilance, and surrender to or worship of the indwelling omnipresence.",
"33. When distracted by wayward or perverted rationalisation, suitable counter-measures should be adopted to keep away or remove such obstacles, especially by the contemplation of the other point of view.",
"34. Wayward or perverted reasoning is often indulged in to rationalise violence, etc., whether such violence etc., are direct personal actions, or indirectly caused, or merely witnessed or acquiesced in. These can be mild, moderate or grave transgressions. However, they have greed, hate and stupidity as their antecedents, and they yield the bitter fruits of endless sorrow, and ever-deepening darkness of ignorance such contemplation is the effective counter-measure; (or, hence the need for suitable counter-measure).",
"35. When there is natural firmness in non-violence, all hostility comes to an end in its very presence. Conflict ceases in such a mind.",
"36 When there is firm grounding in the perception of what is, or of truth, it is seen that an action and reaction, seed and its fruits, or cause and result, are related to each other; and the clear vision of intelligence becomes directly aware of this relationship; (Or, one's words are fruitful).",
"37. When the intelligence firmly rejects desire to hoard, and when thus there is natural firmness in non-hoarding, even precious gems stand in front of the yogi, unable to deflect him.",
"38. No effort is involved in living or acting in itself effort implies disorderly movement of energy in several directions as lust, anger, greed, etc. Hence, when the whole being moves effortlessly in the cosmic homogeneous essence, and thus there is movement of energy in a single direction, which is really non-movement, there is great conservation of energy. It is not dissipated in diverse sensual and psychic activities. The worst dissipation of energy is sexuality. Hence the yogi is wedded to chastity in thought, word and deed, which he carefully preserves through the practice of yoga postures, pranayama, right diet, contemplation, holy company, and prayer. Effortless chastity promotes energy.",
"39. When the inner light of intelligence illumines the state of mind that has firmly rejected all greed and there is contentment with what life brings unsolicited, there arises knowledge of the mysteries of life and its why and how.",
"40. The habit of cleanliness, if it is not mechanical and ritualistic but intelligent with an understanding of the nature of decaying physical organism, reveals the impure nature of the physical body: and, there arises disgust for the body and a disinclination for contact with those of others.",
"41. And, such a habit of cleanliness also leads to the purification of the whole substance, peace and basic goodness of mind, one-pointedness, mastery over the senses, as also the ability (and the qualification) to attain self-knowledge.",
"42. From contentment there flows the most excellent happiness and delight.",
"43 The inner psychic fire destroys all impurities of the heart and mind, and brings about the health, sanity, wholeness or perfection of the physical and vital being (the inner senses).",
"44 By study (not necessarily nor exclusively) of scriptures, and of oneself, the consciousness is united with the desired or loved divinity. This divinity may well be a luminous internal transmutation-experience or its externalised psychic manifestation, or an enlightened being.",
"45. Perfection in self-awareness instantly follows total, dynamic and intelligent surrender of the individual ego-sense (in the sense of the realisation of its unreal nature) or the merging of it in the indwelling omnipresence (in the sense of the direct realisation of the falsity of the me, the ego-sense, and therefore the sole reality of the indwelling omnipresence).",
"46. The posture of the body during the practice of contemplation and at other times, as also the posture of the mind (or attitude to life) should be firm and pleasant.",
"47. Such a posture can be attained (1) by the abandonment of effort and the non-use of will, and (2) by the continuous awareness of the infinite eternal existence.",
"48. Then follows immunity from the onslaughts of the pairs of inseparable opposites like pain and pleasure, heat and cold, success and failure, honour and dishonour.",
"49. Simultaneously, the interruption and reversal (and therefore the balancing) of the flow of inhalation and exhalation, of the positive (life-promoting) energy and the negative (decay-promoting) energy, constitutes the regulation of the life-force which is then experienced as the totality of all its functional aspects previously and ignorantly viewed as the building up and the breaking down opposed to each other.",
"50. Different techniques involve holding the breath within (after inhalation), or without (after exhalation), or the suspension of the breath, with conscious effort. There are different types, too: some prolonged, some subtle (and short) different also in regard to the place where the breath is held, the duration of the retention, and the number of times it is practiced.",
"51. There is a fourth type which is the spontaneous suspension of breath, while minutely observing something external or internal.",
"52. Then, the veil of psychic impurity and spiritual ignorance that covers the inner light is thinned and rent asunder.",
"53. And, the mind attains the ability to concentrate, to focus its attention.",
"54. There is psychological freedom when the senses function spontaneously in complete harmony with the inherent intelligence (without thought or will-interference) without being drawn into contact with their objects by cravings or false evaluations. This freedom is the fountain-source of energy since in it there is effortless (and therefore non-) movement of the energy.",
"55 With such an abundance of energy it follows that there is complete mastery (in the sense of ever-vigilant understanding) over the senses, as all psychological conflicts and confused movements of thought and energy cease, and the senses function intelligently without disorder and disharmony, inhibitions and excitation."
],[
"1. When the attention of the mind-stuff is directed in a single stream to a chosen field, without being dissipated and thus distracted that is concentration.",
"2. When the cognition is entirely concentrated in that field thus becoming its own field of observation that is, when the observer is observed it is meditation.",
"3. When the field of observation and the observing intelligence merge as if their own form is abolished and the total intelligence shines as the sole substance or reality, there is pure choiceless awareness without the divided identity of the observer and the observed that is illumination.",
"4. When these three happen together, there is perfect inner discipline. This can happen during what is commonly known as the practice of meditation, and during any other form of physical or mental activity.",
"5 When such inner discipline is mastered, there arises the vision that is wisdom.",
"6. This vision (or the eye of intuition, or the eye of wisdom, or the inner light) can be directed to many fields of observation.",
"7. These three are inner spiritual practices compared to the other five already described viz., discipline, observances, posture, exercise of the life-force, and introversion of attention.",
"8. But even these three are external to that enlightenment in which the very seed of duality ceases to exist.",
"9. Here, again, it is possible to conceive of three stages, though such sequence is not inevitable. At first there is the effortless, though not mechanical, habit of shutting out an undesirable or disturbing thought. This ability arises when there is direct awareness of the moment of the rise of the movement of restraint and the cessation of the movement of thought, and thus there is the understanding of the dynamics of thought. This understanding itself is the formation of the faculty of restraint of undesired thoughts.",
"10. Though at first this may seem to involve effort, struggle and striving, when the habit of restraint is formed, there is effortless, tranquil and spontaneous flow of the movement of restraint, and the prevention of the undesired movement of thought.",
"11. The second stage is the non-arising of distractions on account of the weakening of the numerous distracting thoughts, and the effortless and natural unidirectional flow of the mind-stuff. At this state, the mind-stuff is favourably disposed towards illumination as the obstacles to such illumination are rendered inoperative.",
"12. When the two movements of thought-arising and thought-subsiding, the movements of distraction and of restraint, are of equal force, the mind-stuff is in a perfectly balanced state, which is one of non-division or no-polarity. There is neither (volitional) thinking nor suppression of thought, and the intelligence has its natural, effortless unidirectional movement which is in fact no-movement.",
"13. Thus (that is, by explaining the dynamics of thought) the nature, characteristics and changes in the states relating to all the cognitive faculties and their objects have been explained: for they are closely related to and are essentially non-different from the movement of thought in the mind-stuff.",
"14. For, a substance itself is put together and recognised as such by, and is non-different from, a particular characteristic which may be in a dormant state, in an emerging state or in an uncertain or potential state.",
"15. Surely, it is because of the existence of such a clear distinction of character of substances and of the order in the sequence of the changes, that there is predictability of the transformation.",
"16. Therefore, knowledge of the past and of the future (and such knowledge as not already possessed) follows the practice of the three-fold inner discipline (concentration, meditation and illumination together) in relation to the fundamental principle of the three stages of the movement of thought the movement of restraint, the non-arising of distractions, and the perfectly balanced state.",
"17. Language, meaning and conceptualisation are always superimposed on one another, causing habit-patterns in communication. By the practice of the threefold inner discipline on their differences there arises an understanding of the sounds uttered by all beings.",
"18. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the inherent tendencies, and by the direct perception of such tendencies, knowledge of previous existence arises.",
"19. In an intimate knowledge of the ground of the Mind, there is what at first sight appears to be a supernatural knowledge of other minds, too, because in fact the intelligence that is misunderstood as the mind is indivisible.",
"20. This, however, does not imply particularised knowledge of the other personalities, e.g., the motivations, the conditioning or the background of the other minds for knowledge of the other mind is impersonal and devoid of images and details.",
"21. By the practice of the threefold inner discipline on the form and the substantiality of the body, one can comprehend directly the energy that makes it possible to grasp it with the eyes and so forth (for the flow of light-waves is the form); and when this energy function is suspended, the dynamics of perception is made inoperative, the link between the perceiving eye and light is severed as it were and invisibility occurs. ",
"22. (Some editions have an additional sutra here suggesting similar phenomenon with the sense of hearing.)",
"23. Action performed here yields results either immediately (if the action is of great intensity) or in course of time (if it lacks intensity). By the practice of the threefold inner discipline on the intensity or on the chain of action-reaction or the law of cause and effect, there comes knowledge of death (though not knowledge of the ultimate extinction of the ego-sense or liberation). This knowledge can also be gained by such discipline directed towards omens and portents.",
"24. By the practice of the threefold discipline on qualities like friendship, one becomes an embodiment of such qualities naturally, and thus one gains great moral, psychic and spiritual strength.",
"25. By the practice of the threefold discipline on various kinds of strength (physical, mental, moral, psychic and spiritual) one grows to be as strong as, say, an elephant.",
"26. By correctly directing and focussing the light of perception in which the senses and their objects (the whole of nature) function, knowledge can be gained of the subtle, the hidden, and even the remote objects or phenomena.",
"27. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the sun, a knowledge of the physical universe is gained.",
"28. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the moon, there arises a knowledge of the stellar system.",
"29. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the pole star, there comes a knowledge of its movement (or the movement of the stars).",
"30. By the practice of the threefold inner discipline at the psychic centre at the navel (the Manipura cakra) the knowledge of the physiology of the body is gained.",
"31. By the practice of the threefold discipline at the pit of the throat (or, the psychic centre known as the Visuddha cakra), freedom from hunger and thirst is gained.",
"32. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the kurma-nadi, steadiness of the body and the mind is gained.",
"33. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the light that appears in the crown of the head during meditation, one has the vision of sages who have attained perfection.",
"34. All these can also be gained by direct intuitive perception; (Or, by the practice of the threefold discipline on the inner light, all knowledge is gained).",
"35. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the spiritual heart (or the psychic centre Anahata) there arises knowledge concerning the mind-stuff or the undivided intelligence.",
"36. The external object is totally distinct and different from what the experiencing personality thinks it is. When, in a state of ignorance, the personality forgets this, and as the object is imagined to be external for the enjoyment of another (which is the enjoyer), he experiences pain and pleasure. When the threefold discipline is directed towards the substance of this self or personality (or, towards the selfishness), there arises the knowledge of the indwelling intelligence, with its conditioning which is the ignorance.",
"37. Thereupon (since knowledge of ignorance is the dispelling of ignorance, and the intelligence that comprehends the mental conditioning is unconditioned) there come into being enlightened hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting and smelling free from the perversions, limitations and distortions born of ignorance.",
"38. But, even such excellent sensations and feelings and the psychic powers described thus far, which on the surface appear to be desirable and encouraging aspects of perfection, are in fact impediments to enlightenment as they, too, distract and externalise the attention.",
"39. When there is loosening of the bondage of the consciousness to the body, as also an understanding of the proper channel of the consciousness's entry into and its withdrawal from the body, the mind acquires the ability to enter another body.",
"40. When the anti-gravitational vital force that has an ascending flow is directly understood, there follow powers of levitation and passage over water, mud, thorny bush, etc., without coming into contact with them.",
"41. When the vital force which maintains equilibrium and which fills the entire body with light, life and power, is directly perceived and understood, there is effulgence and radiance of one's personality.",
"42. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the relation between space, as the medium of sound, and the sense of hearing, supernatural hearing is gained (since the flow of sound-waves is identical with ether or space).",
"43. When the threefold inner discipline is directed towards the relationship between the body and the space in which it moves, and when there is contemplation of the weightlessness of cotton, the body acquires the quality of weightlessness and moves in space with ease.",
"44. Beyond all these is the state of consciousness which is not the product of thought; and that is the cosmic intelligence which is independent of the body (or bodies physical, astral and causal). By the practice of the threefold discipline upon that, the veil that covers that light of cosmic intelligence is removed.",
"45. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the gross (tangible, with form) and the subtle (intangible, formless), and their conjunction, and the direct perception of their apparently substantial nature, there arises the perfect understanding of the elements that constitute that existence.",
"46. Thence follow psychic powers like the ability to reduce the body to the size of an atom, etc., and perfection of body and its immunity from the ravages of the elements of nature.",
"47. What constitutes perfection of the body? Beauty, grace, strength, and adamantine firmness.",
"48. By the practice of the threefold discipline on the sense-functions (their action, their characteristics, their fragmentary nature, their mutual relationship, and their substance or their meaningfulness in relation to the indwelling intelligence on account of which alone they are able to function) comes their total understanding and true mastery over them.",
"49. When such understanding has been gained, the senses function with the speed of the mind, and there is direct perception without the need of intermediary instruments (even the sense-organs) and the realisation of oneness with the entire cosmic nature.",
"50. The direct realisation of the independence of the indwelling intelligence from the mind, that is from the conditions to which the psychic and the physical nature is subject, brings with it superintendence over all states of being, and omniscience.",
"51. When there is no craving or attraction even for such supremacy and for such omniscience, all of which suggest a division in consciousness, and when the sense of duality which is the seed for imperfection, impurity, or conditioned existence ceases, there is total freedom and a direct realisation of the indivisibility and hence the independence of intelligence.",
"52. Invitations that involve the demonstration of such powers or of the characteristics of enlightenment, even when extended by those in authority whether on earth or in heaven, are summarily rejected without being swayed by attachment or even curiosity. Otherwise, undesirable consequences may arise again, by the revival of duality, superiority, hope and despair, etc.",
"53. Undistracted by these, one should proceed to transcend time. By the practice of the threefold discipline in relation to the truth of the moment, without the interference of thought which creates the false sequence of time, there arises understanding which is born of the faculty to perceive the false as false and hence truth as truth.",
"54. From such understanding flows knowledge or the natural ability to distinguish between reality and appearance, even where they do not have other obvious distinguishing marks related to their species, characteristics and location and hence seem to be similar. The possibility of confusion is thus completely overcome.",
"55. Such wisdom born of intuitive and immediate understanding is the sole redeemer. It is everything. It has everything. It encompasses everything. It is the unconditioned and undivided intelligence spontaneously functioning from moment to moment in the eternal now, without sequential relationship.",
"56. When thus there is pure equilibrium which is non-division between the indwelling consciousness and all (objective) existence, between the non-moving intelligence and the ever-moving phenomena, between the unconditioned awareness and the rise and fall of the thousand thoughts there is freedom and independence of the infinite."

"1. The attainments listed in the previous section are not only the fruits of the threefold inner discipline, but they are congenital in some, and in others they may follow the right and intelligence use of certain medicinal herbs or of certain mantras (mystic formulae or advice), or they may follow the kindling of the psychic fire.",
"2. However, congenital endowments are not accidental, as the incidence of birth is determined by the character or quality with which one's whole being is saturated.",
"3. To be so saturated does not involved acquiring or adding some new quality; for the transmutation of one's nature is not effected by the introduction of a new cause but by the removal of that which obstructs the realisation of that nature. The new practice is a catalyst and is otherwise useless: and people of different natures make different choices. As in agriculture: there is fertility in the seed and the soil, and effort is directed at the removal of the weeds and the pests.",
"4. Any attempt to introduce a new transforming influence can only erect one more barrier as such a construction of the mind-stuff (as the new influence or image is) is obviously and only a product of the ego-sense.",
"5. However many such images one may build within oneself, all these are projected by a single ego-sense in the mind-stuff, though the operations of the diverse successive images may vary, giving the false feeling of methodical and rapid spiritual progress.",
"6. Hence, the no-image that is born of meditation is the best because it does not create a receptacle for itself, entrench itself as a real image, and colour the mind.",
"7. The yogis' actions, springing from such no-image, are therefore neither pure nor impure whereas in the case of others, actions are of three classes, kinds or types viz., pure, impure and mixed.",
"8. The images that are built in the mind and the actions that flow from them colour the mind creating tendencies which manifest when conditions are favourable.",
"9. The relation between the actions, the tendencies they create, and the manifestation of these tendencies in behaviour may be vague: especially when the behaviour and its antecedents are separate in time, place, and embodiment yet the latent impressions (tendencies) and memory are identical in nature.",
"10. However, it is difficult to determine their exact operation, and it is futile to analyse them. These memories and these tendencies are beginningless for hope or desire-tolive is permanent.",
"11. Yet, since these tendencies have a cause-and-effect relationship with ignorance (that is, they are the result of ignorance and also the cause of its perpetuation) they disappear when the cause (ignorance of the spiritual truth) is dispelled, and vice versa: they support and promote each other and are bound to each other.",
"12. But that does not imply that the past (the memory and the tendencies) is false and that the future is abolished (by their disappearance). The past and the future exist in reality, in their own form because the characteristics and the natural differences of countless beings follow different paths.",
"13. These differences are of the quality of the beings, not of the being itself. And, they may be either subtle or obvious.",
"14. Surely, the material world exists: though it is seen that it constantly undergoes change, there is some substance which thus undergoes change.",
"15. The world of matter is entirely neutral and homogeneous. Differences (like good and evil, beauty and ugliness) are perceived because such differences are created by viewpoints oriented to different directions or goals.",
"16. An object or a substance in this world is not dependent for its existence on one mind. Else, would it not cease to be if that mind does not cognise it?",
"17. However, a particular object or substance is comprehended or ignored in accordance with whether the mind is or is not coloured by that object, and is therefore attracted or repelled by that substance. Hence the quality or the description of the substance is dependent on the mind: whereas its existence is independent of it.",
"18. All such changes, colourings and modifications of the mind are always known to the lord of the mind, the indwelling intelligence, since that intelligence is changeless.",
"19. Surely, it cannot be said that the mind is self-luminous and can know itself; it (its changes and modifications) is perceived only by the inner light or the indwelling intelligence.",
"20. Nor can it be said that the mind is simultaneously both the perceiver and the perceived, the observer and the observed. For, then there would not be rational comprehension.",
"21. If it is assumed that there are two minds the observer and the observed this would result in logical absurdity (since both are based on the same intelligence, who designates the distinction?) and also confusion of memory or universal schizophrenia, which is not found to be the case.",
"22. The undivided intelligence or homogeneous consciousness in which there is no movement of thought is aware of its own enlightened or awakened nature on account of its awareness of the apparent movement of thought. There is paradoxical movement in non-movement which is the total intelligence.",
"23. The same mind takes on the role of the observer and the very same mind then observes the colouring of the mind which becomes the observed the subject and the object: it is indeed everything. Hence, the self is but an idea.",
"24. Though the mind is motivated in its actions by numerous and diverse tendencies, in reality, it exists and functions for another because it is able to function in conjunction with the undivided indwelling intelligence. The mind does not exist apart from that intelligence and the diverse tendencies.",
"25. One who sees this completely and clearly is freed from the false and imaginary notion of self.",
"26. Then the whole mind flows towards wisdom and the realisation of complete freedom or liberation.",
"27. It is possible, during such periods when this awareness of this freedom is interrupted, there arise other thoughts on account of the mind's past habits of thinking.",
"28. These habit-moulds are also to be treated as sources of psychic distress or disturbance and got rid of in the manner described already.",
"29. Where there is no interest in or attraction whatsoever even for the highest kind of intellectual knowledge and experience and where there is uninterrupted self-awareness, there comes a state of enlightenment which is like a cloud that showers virtue or order.",
"30. When thus order is restored in the mind and therefore in behaviour, all actions that favour psychic distress are effortlessly avoided.",
"31. Then, since all the veils have been removed and all the impurities have been destroyed, there is infinite knowledge little remains to be known or experienced (or, the objects of knowledge or experience are seen to be conditioned, finite and worthless.)",
"32. Thus, they who have realised this have fulfilled their mission in life. And the beginningless succession of changes of the qualities or characteristics, that was falsely assumed to be related to the self which itself was the first notion comes to an end; (Or, the succession of changes of qualities which have reached the fulfilment of their purpose comes to an end).",
"33. What is regarded as continuous succession is only a series of individual and independent moments. When the last moment is not apprehended as being part of a continuum, the false notion of succession and therefore of time comes to an end.",
"34. The qualities and the characteristics of a person have no goal nor motivation any more. They return to their cause, ignorance! There emerges creative independence. The undivided cosmic intelligence which is omnipotent regains as it were its own identity."

"11. Smṛti (or recollection) (smṛtiḥ) is the reproduction, without taking anything from any other sources (asampramoṣaḥ), of the thing (viṣaya) that was (previously) experienced (anubhūta)",
"12. There is suppression (nirodhaḥ) of that (i.e. of the previous five mental modifications) (tad) by means of Abhyāsa --practice-- and Vairāgya --renunciation-- (abhyāsavairāgyābhyām)",

"16. Indifference (vaitṛṣṇyam) to the Guṇa-s, (the qualities of nature) (guṇa), because of a knowledge (khyāteḥ) of Puruṣa (puruṣa) is called the highest (Vairāgya or Renunciation) (tad param)",
"17. Samprajñātasamādhi (samprajñātaḥ) (is achieved) by means of (anugamāt) Vitarka, Vicāra, Ānanda and Asmitā (vitarkavicārānandāsmitārūpa)",

(There are two types of causes for Nirvījasamādhi --a Samādhi without an object to meditate on--: upāyapratyaya --the mental condition that is the outcome of a conscious effort by using a method-- and bhavapratyaya --the mental condition that is the outcome of latent impressions of ignorance--. The first type produces Asamprajñātasamādhi, while the second one brings about a similar but not identical state).

(However,) in the case of those who tread the path of the conscious effort by using a method --upāya-- (itareṣām), (Nirvījasamādhi --which is now real Asamprajñātasamādhi--) is preceded (pūrvakaḥ) by faith (śraddhā), vigor (vīrya), recollection (smṛti), full concentration (samādhi) (and) true knowledge (prajñā)",

"49. From that (aforesaid Saṁyama) (tatas), swiftness (javitvam) (as) of mind (manas), a state (bhāvaḥ) in which the organs of sense act independently of the body (vikaraṇa), and (ca) victory (jayaḥ) over Pradhāna --i.e. Prakṛti, the original source of the material universe-- (pradhāna) (are secured)",

To one established in (discriminative) knowledge (khyāti-mātrasya) of the difference (anyatā) between Buddhisattva --i.e. sattvic Buddhi full of discriminative knowledge-- (sattva) (and) Puruṣa (puruṣa) (comes) supremacy (adhiṣṭhātṛtvam) over all (sarva) beings (bhāva) and (ca) omniscience (sarvajñātṛtvam)",
"51. By renunciation (vairāgyāt) even (api) of that --i.e. of Vivekakhyāti or discriminative knowledge-- (tad), when there is destruction (kṣaye) of the seeds (vīja) of evil (doṣa), Kaivalya or complete Emancipation (kaivalyam) (is experienced)",
"52. When invited (upanimantraṇe) by beings occupying a high position --i.e. celestial beings-- (sthāni), (that invitation) should not be accepted (saṅga... akaraṇam) nor should it cause (akaraṇam) conceit (smaya), since it involves the possibility (prasaṅgāt) of undesirable results (punar-aniṣṭa)",
"53. Through Saṁyama (saṁyamāt) on moment (kṣaṇa) (and) its (tad) sequence or succession --i.e. krama-- (kramayoḥ), a knowledge (jñānam) which arises (jam) from (that) discernment or discrimination (viveka) (is acquired)",
"54. Through that (knowledge) (tatas), there is clear perception (of the difference) (pratipattiḥ) between two things looking alike (tulyayoḥ) since difference (anyatā) is indiscernible (anavacchedāt) by means of class or species (jāti), temporal character (lakṣaṇa) (and) position --i.e. deśa-- (deśaiḥ)",
"55. In other words, even though two things look alike because the difference is indiscernible via class or species, temporal character and position, the Yogī can perceive the difference through that knowledge obtained by practicing Saṁyama on moment and its sequence. Knowledge (jñānam) which arises (jam) from discernment or discrimination (viveka) is Tāraka or intuitive knowledge (tārakam). (It is) comprehensive of all (sarva) things (viṣayam) appearing (viṣayam) at all times (sarvathā) and (ca) has no sequence (akramam... iti) Note that iti stands for inverted commas. ",
"56. When there is equality (sāmye) of purity (śuddhi) between Buddhisattva --i.e. sattvic Buddhi-- (sattva) (and) Puruṣa (puruṣayoḥ), the state of complete Emancipation (kaivalyam iti) (dawns).  Note that iti now indicates the end of the section.  ",

"1. The Siddhi-s or Supernatural Powers (siddhayaḥ) come (jāḥ) with birth (janma), (or they are achieved by means of) herbs (auṣadhi), mantra-s (mantra), austerities (tapas) (or) perfect concentration (samādhi)",
"2. The transformation (pariṇāmaḥ) into other (antara) species (jāti) (is accomplished) through the filling in (āpūrāt) of their essential nature (prakṛti)1 -- 1 In other words, the mould of the new species into which one wants to be transformed fills in (or permeate) the essential nature of the new body and organs and shapes them according to the respective parameters. It is as if one were to exert pressure on a pile of wet sand with a recipient. The wet sand will assume the form of that recipient, no doubt. The process of transformation from one species into another proceeds in a similar way. ",
"3. Cause (nimittam) (does not set) the essential natures (prakṛtīnām) into motion (aprayojakam) but (tu) it breaks down (bhedaḥ) the barrier (or mound) (varaṇa). For that reason (tatas), it is like (vat) the farmer (kṣetrika) (who breaks down a barrier or mound so that the water may flow into his field)",
"4. The created (nirmāṇa) minds (cittāni) are (produced) from the pure (mātrāt) I-sense (asmitā)",
"5. (Only) one (ekam) mind (cittam) (sets) the many (created minds) (anekeṣām) into motion (prayojakam) during their various (bhede) activities (pravṛtti)",
"6. Of these (created minds) (tatra), (those) brought about (jam) through meditation (dhyāna) are without any (an) latent impressions (āśayam)",
"7. The action (karma) of a Yogī (yoginaḥ) is neither white (aśukla) nor black (akṛṣṇam), (while) those of others (itareṣām) are of three kinds (trividham)",
"8. From that --i.e. from those three aforesaid kinds of action-- (tatas), (there is) certainly (eva) manifestation (abhivyaktiḥ) of Vāsanā-s1 (vāsanānām) suitable --anuguṇa-- (anuguṇānām) to the consequences or results (vipāka) of that --i.e. of the three abovementioned types of action-- (tad). Careful here with the technical terms: Vāsanā-s are latent impressions of feelings produced by birth, life-span and experience of pleasure and pain. Also note that Vāsanā is not synonymous with Karmāśaya, despite both of them being latent impressions, since the latter arises out of actions or karma and not out of feelings like the former. There is a big difference between those two kinds of latent impressions. In turn, the word saṁskāra is commonly used to designate latent impressions in general. Use these terms properly, please.",
"9. Because of similarity (ekarūpatvāt) between memory (smṛti) (and) latent impressions --saṁskāra-- (saṁskārayoḥ), (there is) immediate (ānantaryam) (emergence of Vāsanā-s) even though (api) separated --vyavahita-- (vyavahitānām) by birth (jāti), space or position (deśa) (and) time (kāla)",
"10. Seeing that the desire for self-welfare --āśīs-- (āśiṣaḥ) is eternal --nitya-- (nityatvāt), those (Vāsanā-s) --tās-- (tāsām) (from which it emerges are) also (ca) beginningless (anāditvam)",
"11. Since (Vāsanā) is held together (saṅgṛhītatvāt) by cause (hetu), fruit or result (phala), refuge (āśraya) (and) support --i.e. ālambana or the supporting object which attracts Vāsanā-- (ālambanaiḥ), in the absence (abhāve) of these --i.e. cause, fruit or result, refuge and support-- (eṣām), (there is also) absence (abhāvaḥ) of that (Vāsanā) (tad)",
"12. Past (atīta) (and) future (anāgatam) exist (asti) in their essential forms (sva-rūpataḥ). (The difference is only) in the characteristics (of the forms) (dharmāṇām) at different (bhedāt) times or phases --i.e. past, present and future-- (adhva)",
"13. Those (characteristics) (te) are manifest (vyakta) (and) subtle --sūkṣma-- (sūkṣmāḥ) (and) consist (ātmānaḥ) of the (three) Guṇa-s (guṇa)",
"14. Due to the coordinated or coincidental (ekatvāt) mutation (of the three Guṇa-s) (pariṇāma), an object (vastu) appears to be something real (tattvam)",
"15. Despite sameness (sāmye) of objects (vastu), there is a different (vibhaktaḥ) way or path (panthāḥ) to them both --i.e. object and its inherent knowledge-- (tayoḥ) since there are different (bhedāt) minds (citta)",
"16. The object (vastu) certainly (ca) is not (na) dependent (tantram) on only one (eka) mind (citta), (because if so,) what (kim) would happen (syāt) when (the object) is not experienced or cognized (apramāṇakam) by that (mind) (tad) then (tadā)?",
"17. The object (vastu) is known (jñāta) (or) unknown (ajñātam) to the mind (cittasya) according to how (apekṣitvāt) it colors (uparāga) that (very mind) (tad)",
"18. To the Lord or Master --i.e. Puruṣa-- (prabhoḥ) of that --i.e. of mind-- (tad), the mental (citta) modifications (vṛttayaḥ) (are) always (sadā) known (jñātāḥ) because of the immutability (apariṇāmitvāt) of (that very) Puruṣa (puruṣasya)",
"19. That (mind) (tad) is not (na) self-illuminating (sva-ābhāsam) since it is a knowable object (dṛśyatvāt)",
"20. And (ca) there is no cognizance (anavadhāraṇam) of them both --i.e. mind and knowable objects-- (ubhaya) simultaneously (ekasamaye)",
"21. (If one's own mind were to be) a knowable object (dṛśye) to another (antara) mind (citta), (then there would be) a undue extension (atiprasaṅgaḥ) of Buddhi(s) (buddheḥ) of Buddhi-s (buddhi) and (ca) intermixture (saṅkaraḥ) of memories (smṛti)",
"22. When Citi or Consciousness (citeḥ), though untransmissible--apratisaṅkramā-- (apratisaṅkramāyāḥ), takes on --āpatti-- (āpattau) the form (ākāra) of that --i.e. of Buddhi-- (tad), (it becomes) the consciousness or intelligence (saṁvedanam) of one's own (sva) Buddhi (buddhi)",
"23. Mind (cittam), being affected (uparaktam) by (both) the seer (draṣṭṛ) and the seen (dṛśya), (is) all-comprehensive (sarva-artham)",
"24. That (mind) (tad), although (api) variegated (citram) by innumerable (asaṅkhyeya) Vāsanā-s --i.e. latencies resulting from feelings, not actions-- (vāsanābhiḥ), (exists) for (artham) another --i.e. Puruṣa-- (para) inasmuch as (its constituents) act (kāritvāt) conjointly (saṁhatya)",
"25. To one who knows (darśinaḥ) the special distinction (viśeṣa) --i.e. to one who has realized Puruṣa or the Self--, there is cessation (vinivṛttiḥ) of the practice of pondering (bhāvanā) over the nature (bhāva) of his (own) Self (ātma)",
"26. Then (tadā), the mind (cittam) inclines (nimnam) toward discriminative (knowledge) (viveka) (and) is directed (prāk-bhāram) toward complete Liberation (kaivalya)",
"27. In the holes --i.e. in the breaches-- (chidreṣu) of that (discriminative knowledge) (tad), other (antarāṇi) mental modifications (pratyaya) (emerge) because of (residual) latencies (saṁskārebhyaḥ)",
"28. It is said (uktam) (that) the removal (hānam) of these --i.e. of the mental modifications mentioned in the previous aphorism-- (eṣām) is as (vat) (that of) the Kleśa-s or Afflictions (kleśa)",
"29. One who, having attained discriminative (viveka) knowledge (khyāteḥ) in the highest degree and at all times (sarvathā), does not take an interest (akusīdasya) even (api) in (that) omniscience resulting from Vivekajaṁ jñānam or Knowledge arising from discernment --See III 54-- (prasaṅkhyāne), (experiences a type of) Samādhi or Perfect Concentration (samādhiḥ) (known as) Dharmamegha --i.e. Cloud of Virtue-- (dharma-meghaḥ)",
"30. From that --i.e. from Dharmamegha-- (tatas), there is cessation (nivṛttiḥ) of Afflictions (kleśa) (and) actions (karma)",
"31. Then (tadā), due to the infinity (ānantyāt) of knowledge (jñānasya) free --apeta-- (apetasya) from all (sarva) veiling (āvaraṇa) impurities (mala), the knowable(s) (jñeyam) (appear to be) few (alpam)",
"32. From that (Dharmamegha or Cloud of Virtue) (tatas), when the Guṇa-s --i.e. qualities of Prakṛti-- (guṇānām) have accomplished their purpose (kṛta-arthānām), there is cessation (samāptiḥ) of the mutative (pariṇāma) sequence (krama) (of those very Guṇa-s)",
"33. Sequence (kramaḥ) is correlated (pratiyogī) to the moments (kṣaṇa) (and) is perceivable or noticeable (nirgrāhyaḥ) on the termination (aparānta) of the mutations (pariṇāma)",
"34. Complete Liberation (kaivalyam) or (vā) the Power (śaktiḥ) of Consciousness (citi) established (pratiṣṭhā) in her own nature (sva-rūpa) (occurs when) the Guṇa-s --i.e. qualities of Prakṛti-- (guṇānām) return to their original source --i.e. Prakṛti-- (pratiprasavaḥ), as they have no (further) purpose to fulfill (artha-śūnyānām) for Puruṣa (puruṣa) --final iti indicates the end of this scripture--"

"3. Good and bad deeds are not the direct causes in the transformations of nature, but they act as breakers of obstacles to the evolutions of nature: as a farmer breaks the obstacles to the course of water, which then runs down by its own nature.",
"4. From egoism alone proceed the created minds.",
"5. Though the activities of the different created minds are various, the one original mind is the controller of them all.",
"6. Among the various Chittas, that which is attained by Samadhi is desireless.",
"7. Works are neither black nor white for the Yogis; for others they are threefold -- black, white, and mixed.",
"8. From these threefold works are manifested in each state only those desires (which are) fitting to that state alone. (The others are held in abeyance for the time being.)",
"9. There is consecutiveness in desires, even though separated by species, space, and time, there being identification of memory and impressions.",
"10. Thirst for happiness being eternal, desires are without beginning.",
"11. Being held together by cause, effect, support, and objects, in the absence of these is its absence.",
"12. The past and future exist in their own nature, qualities having different ways.",
"13. They are manifested or fine, being of the nature of the Gunas.",
"14. The unity in things is from the unity in changes.",
"15. Since perception and desire vary with regard to the same object, mind and object are of different nature.",
"16. Things are known or unknown to the mind, being dependent on the colouring which they give to the mind. (Sanskrit) ",
"17. The states of the mind are always known, because the lord of the mind, the Purusha, is unchangeable.",
"18. The object cannot be said to be dependent on a single mind. There being no proof of its existence, it would then become non-existent.",
"19. The mind is not self - luminous, being an object.",
"20. From its being unable to cognise both at the same time.",
"21. Another cognising mind being assumed, there will be no end to such assumptions, and confusion of memory will be the result.",
"22. The essence of knowledge (the Purusha) being unchangeable, when the mind takes its form, it becomes conscious.",
"23. Coloured by the seer and the seen the mind is able to understand everything.",
"24. The mind, though variegated by innumerable desires, acts for another (the Purusha), because it acts in combination.",
"25. For the discriminating, the perception of the mind as Atman ceases.",
"26. Then, bent on discriminating, the mind attains the previous state of Kaivalya (isolation).",
"27. The thoughts that arise as obstructions to that are from impressions.",
"28. Their destruction is in the same manner as of ignorance, egoism, etc., as said before (II.10).",
"29. Even when arriving at the right discriminating knowledge of the essences, he who gives up the fruits, unto him comes, as the result of perfect discrimination, the Samadhi called the cloud of virtue.",
"30. From that comes cessation of pain and works.",
"31. The knowledge, bereft of covering and impurities, becoming infinite, the knowable becomes small.",
"32. Then are finished the successive transformations of the qualities, they having attained the end.",
"33. The changes that exist in relation to moments and which are perceived at the other end (at the end of a series) are succession. ",
"34. The resolution in the inverse order of the qualities, bereft of any motive of action for the Purusha, is Kaivalya, or it is the establishment of the power of knowledge in its own nature.",

<h2>Prarthana (प्रार्थना) - Prayers</h2>
<pre>
ॐ सह नाववतु ।
सह नौ भुनक्तु ।
सह वीर्यं करवावहै ।
तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Om, together may we two (the teacher and the student) move (in our studies);
Together may we two relish (our studies);
Together may we two perform (our studies) with vigour;
May what has been studied by us be filled with the brilliance (of understanding); may it not give rise to hostility.
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

- From the Taittiriya Upanishad (तैत्तिरीय उपनिषद्) of the Yajur Veda (यजुर्वेदः)

योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शरीरस्य च वैद्यकेन । 
योपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्राञ्जलिरानतोस्मि ॥

The impurities of the mind by yoga, speech by grammar and the impurities of the body through medical science,
he who is an expert in removing the impurities, to that most excellent of munis, Patanjali, I bow down with folded hands.

- From a traditional verse, cited in Sivarama Tripathin's Kanchanadarpana (a commentary on the tale Vasavadatta)
</pre>

<h2>Sankalpa (संकल्पः) - Intention Setting</h2>
<pre>
For removing all problems and pains in life,
for making Lord Parameshwara happy,
for the blessings and grace of Goddess Parvathi,
for the realization of the Self, and
for the peace and prosperity of all beings,
I am going to study the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.

<h2>About Patanjala Yogasutrani</h2>

The objective of this work is to support the study of Yoga, which is one of the six aastika darshanas of Sanatana Dharma; any academic or technical excursions are incidental to the core pursuit. 

Through a web page, we support navigation of the yoga sutras by chapter and verse. For each verse, we provide the chapter name, chapter number, verse number, and verse text (in Devanagari Unicode, ITRANS, and IAST formats). We provide English translations from several sources. We provide browser-based basic speech-to-text of the original verse and one English translation. We also provide links to a traditional chant of each verse. We provide an interface to an online Sanskrit-English dictionary, as well as a tool for transliteration between ITRANS and Devanagari Unicode. Additional notes by the editor for each sutra is included.<p>

The associated software repository is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/rajesh-krishnan/pys.github.io">github</a>. This is a work in progress. For now, we are attempting a client-side solution with static content that can be hosted locally or on a webserver; a modern browser supporting Javascript, HTML, and CSS should suffice. We were originally planning to release this software under the Unlicense, but unfortunately, the transliteration code by <a href="http://shreevatsa.appspot.com/sanskrit/transliterate.html">Shreevatsaji</a> has a GPLv2 or higher license. Note that we have edited the transliteration code slightly to include the pranava (Om symbol).<p>

Although the Patanjala yoga darshana is limited to using pratyaksha, anumana, and agama, we include references to works by those who apply a vedantic interpretation (admitting upama, anupalabdhi, and athApatti as pramanas). Although the Patanjala Yoga Darshana is agamic, we do not exclude translations and references to other nigamic, smriti, and puranic sources; nor do we exclude sources from other traditions. We follow Veda Vyasa, Srimad Adi Shankara Bhagadpada, and Swami Sivananda Sarawasti, who maintain there is harmony between the yoga and vedanta darsharnas. As we do not include full commentaries, and only quote translations from other sources, we believe this constitutes fair use of quoted material. <p>

Future versions may include:
<ol>
  <li>English translation of Maharishi Veda Vyasa's commentary</li>
  <li>Additional notes with cross references to related verses, references to other classical yoga texts, and other commentary</li>
  <li>Grammatical analysis of the sutras by computer</li>
  <li>Index of root words (dhatus) in the sutras</li>
  <li>Personal notes for each sutra loaded from a user-specified file</li>
</ol>
